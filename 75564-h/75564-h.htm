<p><span class="smcap">The</span> favourable reception accorded to the
first edition has induced me to give the present
a more definite educational character.
Foot-notes are appended, referring to the
position in the British Museum of all the
principal antiquities, fossils, and implements
mentioned in the text; so that the specimens
can easily be found by any young student
who wishes, with the book in his hand, to
make himself familiar with these records of
past time. This will probably facilitate the
search for and recognition of specimens by
the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</span></p>

<p>The additions to the text consist chiefly
of a more extended account of the deposition
of chalk and other deep-sea formations,
founded on the results of the “Challenger”
and “Tuscarora” expeditions, and a sketch of
the earthworks of the Ohio mound-builders
and the stone monuments of Easter Island.
Examples of pre-historic art and lake-dwellings
have been added to the illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> found that children could be interested
in the history of life upon the Earth, and
that it appealed forcibly to their understanding,
I considered that a little book upon the
subject might give them the taste for more
extended study in after years. The difficulty
of treating the, to them, novel conclusions of
geology, often founded on abstract reasoning,
in language simple in form yet stating
clearly the great principles upon which this
reasoning rests, will probably be apparent on
every page. Breadth, rather than minuteness,
has been aimed at, in the belief that a general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
view, not overcrowded with details, is likely
to be the most impressive. Thus, in the
geological part the leading features of the succession
of strata have been preserved, but
no details of systematic classification entered
into. Similarly, Primeval Man is considered
mainly with reference to gradual progress
from a rude to a more civilized condition.
To have been more explicit, where there is
still much difference of opinion, would have
obscured the main facts of the evidence for
man’s great antiquity.</p>

<p>The illustrations are typical examples of
the three arbitrary but convenient divisions of
the history of life—the vegetable, the animal,
and the human—such as will be most readily
met with in museums. Slight as this sketch
is, the liking for it shown by some intelligent
children, who saw it in manuscript, encouraged
me to believe that there are many
others to whom it might prove interesting.</p>

<p>Some acquaintance with the leading facts
in science is daily becoming more necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
to those who aspire to liberal culture, and instruction
in them is a recognised feature in
the curriculum of some public and leading
private schools. Thus, it is hoped that the
present volume may to some extent serve as a
text-book without the severity of such a form.
The best English and foreign authorities have
been consulted, and other trustworthy sources—as
papers read before scientific societies—drawn
upon, bringing the information down to
the latest time. Though these pages are designed
for young persons, other readers, perhaps,
who are not familiar with the subject,
may find some interest in them if they are
not deterred by the necessarily simple style.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. <span class="smcap">H. B. Woodward</span>,
of the Geological Survey of England
and Wales, for some valuable suggestions
made during the progress of the work.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FRAMEWORK_OF_THE_PUZZLE"><em>THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PUZZLE.</em></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must often have looked with wondering
eyes at this World of ours, and
asked yourselves questions about it. How
did it come here? What is it made of?
How old is it? All of them questions not
to be answered without a great deal of
thought and study, and even then not so perfectly
as we should like. It is easy to say “It
is here,” and “It is made of earth,” and “It
surely must be old,” but that will not satisfy
us. We want to know something more certain
than this, if possible. We can see that
a clock goes with wheels, but we are not very
intelligent people if we do not want to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
out what makes the clock go. One way of
finding out is to pull things to pieces, but we
cannot exactly do this with the World. We
must think about it, and put together all the
knowledge we can gain from the outside and
inside, and from the other Worlds around us,
which we can see, and when we have done
this we may get something like answers to
our questions.</p>

<p>How did it come here? But this is not
quite the right way of asking the question,
because the World is never for two moments
together in the same place. It is travelling
in a great circle round the Sun at the rate of
more than sixty thousand miles an hour, and
has been ever since it was formed. That
is a wonderful arrangement by which all
Worlds travel round some other World larger
than themselves, in greater or less circles,
and we do not know why it is, though we
are certain that it is so. The Moon travels
round us once in about every month, and we
and the Moon together round the Sun once in
every year.</p>

<p>Then again, other planets, with their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
moons, such as Jupiter, for instance, travel
round the Sun in much larger circles than our
World, and take many years to do the journey,
while Venus, which is nearer the Sun than we
are, travels in a much smaller circle, and
takes less time. We do not perceive that
we are moving so fast because everything we
see is moving equally fast with us; but there
is no doubt that we are spinning along at
sixty thousand miles an hour.</p>

<p>If we ask an astronomer how our World
came into existence, he will tell us that it is
probably a mass separated from the Sun, that
it was once red-hot, and that it slowly cooled
down until animals and plants could live upon
it. He will tell us besides, that he can see
mountains and valleys in our Moon, and land
and sea, snow and clouds, on the planet Mars,
with his great telescopes. When he thinks
about the planets and our own World, then
he believes them to be pieces of some much
larger World—perhaps the Sun—which now
travel round the Sun and receive their light
and heat from it. The World is made of what
we call “earth,” and it is of this I mean to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
tell you now—how it was formed, what
changes have taken place in it, what plants
and animals have lived upon it, and what
reasons there are for thinking that it is an
exceedingly old place, with a long and interesting
story to tell.</p>

<p>Little was known thirty or forty years ago
by the most learned men about the age of our
World, and it was thought that the human
race had not lived here very long. It was
indeed known that many large animals, whose
huge bones have been found, must have
lived before man came to inhabit the Earth,
and that even far smaller creatures—such as
fishes, and crabs, and insects, and shell-fish—most
probably lived for many generations,
and died and left their bones and shells in
the soil long before the first man or the
first tribes of men came to share the World
with them. I hope to be able to tell you something
of the strange and beautiful history of
all these animals, and of man himself, and
to show you what reasons there are now for
thinking that the human race has inhabited
this Earth for a very long time indeed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
how all this knowledge has been gained and
put together piece by piece. It is something
like the different parts of a puzzle-map,
which might be scattered all over the house,
and found at one time or another in different
places, and at last made up altogether.
Some parts of the puzzle have not been
found yet certainly; but so many have been
collected, and they fit into one another so
well, that we can begin to see its real shape
and size. It will perhaps be a very long time
before some of the missing pieces are found;
but in the meantime we can go on without
them, and put the framework together, and no
doubt in time we shall see what our puzzle,
the history of life on the Earth, was like.</p>

<p>Before telling you what its parts are, I
ought to say where many of them have been
found, and how they are still being looked
for. They are found <em>upon</em> the ground, <em>under</em>
it, in caves, in rivers, and in the sea. Since
railways have been in use a great many tunnels
have been made, as well as very deep
cuttings through hills, and some of these are
several miles long. In this way we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
come to know something of the Earth below
the surface. Some of these tunnels are bored
right through high hills and even mountains,
and the cuttings are deep enough to hide
high houses if they were put into them.
While digging these the workmen have
found many of the parts of our puzzle, which
are the bones of animals, and fishes, and
shells, and even smaller things—such as
insects. These could not possibly have
been put there by anyone, because they were
many, many yards below the surface, and,
until they were dug up, nobody imagined
that they could be there. Many other things
besides have been dug out of these places,
but nearer the surface, such as weapons and
tools made of flint, and stone, and bone, and
metal, and pieces of rough crockery, and
various ornaments, all of which must at
some time or other have been made and
used by people very like ourselves. In
digging canals, too, the same kinds of things
have been found, and some caves are almost
filled up with them. We have other means,
too, of knowing what is under the surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
the ground we walk upon. Many of the
coal-mines are so deep that the Tower of
London, or St. Paul’s Cathedral, or York
Minster, or even the Pyramids of Egypt
could be buried in them! In digging these
the workmen have had to go through a
great quantity of earth, sometimes chalk,
sand, or gravel, or clay or limestone, layer
upon layer, placed, like a pile of books of
different kinds and different thicknesses, one
upon the other, until they have come to
the coal. In these different layers of earth
parts of the puzzle have been found, and we
shall see by-and-by what parts have been
found in the coal itself. Then again, when
deep mines are made to get the metals, iron
and gold and silver, these layers of earth
have to be dug through; and when the
beautiful kinds of stone, like marble and limestone,
are wanted, they must be dug out of
the sides of the hills, and in doing this still
more pieces of the puzzle come to hand.
But there are other places where Nature
herself seems to have shown us some of
them without the trouble of searching for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
them. In many parts of the World, by the
sea, and on the banks of rivers, there are
cliffs hundreds of feet high, like the chalk
cliffs at Dover and Ramsgate, and the sandy
cliffs at Folkestone and on the south coast
of Devonshire. These cliffs have been cut
into by the sea very gradually, and a kind
of wall has been left, and from the sides of
the cliffs great numbers of the pieces of the
puzzle, bones, shells, &amp;c., have been collected
and taken away to museums. But
the little we can do with our mines and railway
tunnels is nothing in comparison with
the work of Nature. In some of the great
mountain chains—the Andes, the Himalayas,
and the Alps, for instance—parts of the sides
of mountains have fallen down, and rents
many miles long have been left, showing
what had been buried there in the different
kinds of soil; and where rivers have cut
deep, narrow channels through the earth,
like the Cañons of Colorado, these natural
miners have turned out more of the parts of
“the puzzle of life” than we can with all our
labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>It will not be easy at first to understand
all the wonders I have to show you, but, when
we get further on, you will see them one
by one, and there will be very little difficulty.
You know now where these things
are to be found: principally in the ground
you walk upon, without knowing all there is
beneath you. The creatures here are much
more wonderful than any of the monsters of
fairy tale or fable, because the works of God
are greater than the imagination of men who
have invented the stories of flying dragons
and griffins, and trees which grew up into the
skies; but I cannot help thinking that this
imagination shows what men thought <em>might</em>
once have been, and we shall see that “truth
is stranger than fiction.” Creatures really did
live on this Earth of such strange shapes and
great size that the imaginations of those
who wrote the fairy tales did not exaggerate
much; and, though we know that no flying
serpents or immense birds like the Roc are
living now, and that there is no beanstalk
which grows up into the sky while we are
asleep, we shall see that there were lizards as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
large as whales, and birds taller than elephants,
and great sloths stronger than the
rhinoceros or hippopotamus, and ferns as
high as oak trees, and mosses as large as
gooseberry bushes; and that perhaps these
animals and plants grew much faster than
they do now, and that their dead bodies form
a very large part of the earth of our World.
This is not imagination, and when you go to
a museum you can see all these wonders for
yourselves, just as they were taken out of
the earth; but of course the bones only of
the animals are there. The flesh has long
since gone away, and some of the stalks and
fronds (leaves) only of the ferns remain to
show us how large they must have been
when they were alive and growing.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to use a few scientific
names, most of which are borrowed from the
Greek and Latin languages, but I will explain
the meaning of them all, so that they
will be easily remembered. First of all,
then, the pieces of the puzzle are called <em>fossils</em>,
and the name comes from a Latin word
meaning “dug out;” because they have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
dug out of the ground either by man in making
railways and mines, or by Nature in the many
ways in which she works by cutting down
cliffs and scooping out valleys. These fossils
are bones of animals and fishes, the skins,
shells, and wings of insects, and the stalks
and leaves of plants, some of which have
lain so very long in the ground that they have
become as hard and heavy as stone. But
the shape of them always remains, and the
moment you look at them you see that they
once belonged to living creatures.</p>

<p>I shall give you pictures of some of these
fossils; and no doubt you will be able to find
some like them in the chalk and sands of the
seaside—beautiful shells and bones of fishes.
You may pick these out of the cliffs, and then
go to the pools of salt water left among the
rocks by the ebbing tide, and compare your
fossils with the living shell-fish, and see how
nearly those inhabitants of the ancient oceans
resemble the creatures we find now, sporting
in the water, just as these fossils did when
the sand and chalk cliffs were under the sea.
Of course all the bright colours are gone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
from the fossils, for the colour of animals
fades away soon after they die, and the flesh
does not last long; but the hard parts—the
bones and shells—are not easily destroyed,
because they are made of the same material
as rocks. And when we look at the fossil
plants we see the same thing. The colours
of the green stems and leaves have quite
faded, but the delicate shapes of the leaves
and branches, and the grain of the wood, can
still be seen, and you will have no doubt that
they once lived and bore flowers and fruit, and
died, as plants are living and dying every day.</p>

<p>You have got so far now that you know
what fossils are, and where they may be
found. You know that they are the small
and large pieces of the “puzzle of life”—of all
sorts of different shapes and sizes—and you
know that they are scattered about the Earth,
deep down in coal-mines, on the tops of
mountains, at the bottoms of rivers, in deep
caves, and under the sea. The patience and
industry of clever men have been well spent
in gathering together all they can find, and
arranging them in museums for our instruction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and making a history of them which is
more wonderful than the Arabian Nights,
and more beautiful because it is all <em>true</em>.
And, though you may think it strange that
I promise to show you creatures more marvellous
than those of the fairy tales, I shall
keep that promise faithfully. We shall find
no Genii with wonderful lamps and magic
rings, because they never really lived, though
it gave us much pleasure and amusement to
read about them; but we shall see what God,
the greatest Genius of all, has done by means
of His magicians—the laws of Nature.
These magicians have built up high mountains
and dug out valleys, and sent mighty
rivers sweeping down to the sea, and even
filled up oceans with sand and chalk, and
buried ancient forests deep down under sea
and land. They worked with fire, and air,
and water; not quickly, but with such
strength that nothing could resist them, and
they gradually moulded the Earth into the
beautiful thing it is, so that</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>But, lovely as the Earth is, we should not
perhaps have thought so much of it if there
had been nothing to discover. We see that
it has been prepared for us an immensely
long time ago; and when we know a little,
we want to search further and find out what
the whole plan of Creation is, so far as we
can. You will be surprised when you know
how many signs of past life there are around
you—many more than you can see with the
eye. The Earth is one great burying-place
of creatures which have passed away. You
are walking over their dead and fossil bodies
at almost every step. They are built into
the walls of our houses, and there are
millions of them in some of the commonest
stones of the pavement. Those round,
smooth pebbles, called flint stones, which we
pick out of the gravel walks, were once partly
such soft tender things as sponges; but time
has hardened them, and they have been
rolled together in seas and rivers by the
always moving water until they have become
quite different to look at from the rough blue
flints they were when they were washed out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
of the chalk beds. When you are walking
along the sands of some seacoasts, you are
treading on little specks of these small flints
which have been ground down fine in that
great mill, the ocean. The sponges, then,
did some part in the building up of the
Earth. The very chalk you draw with is
composed of the shells of sea-animals. Your
slates and slate pencils were once a fine mud
at the bottom of the sea, since become so
hard that it is used for covering the roofs of
our houses, and in this mud lived myriads
of small shell-fish which have sometimes left
their frail houses in the slate beds to tell us
how they were made. That slate is the
hardened mud of an old sea bottom, there is
no doubt at all.</p>

<p>There are many other things in common
use which show us the life that was.</p>

<p>Perhaps you did not know that coals are
<em>compressed plants</em>, and that we are now
burning the vegetation of the past time!
But these will be described in their right
places by-and-by, and you will see how
certain it is that some of the commonest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
things we use were living creatures and
graceful plants.</p>

<p>Here is “the framework” of the puzzle,
and I think you will agree with me that we
shall have pleasure in putting it together
with all the queerly-shaped pieces we shall
find in the following chapters. We have
fossil plants to show us what grew upon the
Earth, fossil bones to tell us what animals
lived here, and thousands of different kinds
of fossil shells and fishes to show us that
the seas in the long past time were crowded
with life; and besides, though there are no
written histories of the men whom we shall
read about, they, too, have left many things
which they used in the caves where they lived
and in their graves, to make us feel certain
that they were some of the oldest people that
ever lived. With all these things to help us, it
will be strange if we cannot make out a great
deal of the history of life upon our Earth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_GEOLOGICAL_PART"><em>THE GEOLOGICAL PART.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">You</span> will have learned from other books
something about the size and shape of our
World: for instance, that it is a great round
body, or rather more like an orange, a little
flatter one way than the other, and about
8,000 miles through, from one side to the
other, and that it turns round once in every
twenty-four hours; but I have only to tell
you now what it is made of. The material
is called rock, earth, or soil; and there are
many kinds of it, such as granite, gravel,
clay, sand, chalk, mud, and so on; and we
shall see that many of these different soils
contain different fossils.</p>

<p>It is supposed that a very long time
passed while these were being laid one upon
another, and before many plants or animals
lived here, and there are good reasons for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
thinking that underneath these soils the
Earth is very hot, perhaps in a melting state,
because we know that volcanoes like Vesuvius
and Ætna throw out flame and smoke and
lava, which is melted earth and rock; and
that this lava has run down the sides of the
mountains for miles, in a great stream of
liquid material, and covered up and destroyed
whole villages and towns. You have heard
of earthquakes, when the ground shakes and
cracks, and houses are thrown down, as they
have often been in Spain, Italy, and South
America. This convinces us that the inside
of the earth must be very different from the outside.
Two or three years ago Mount Vesuvius
was boiling up, and the people of Naples feared
that it would throw out some of the terrible
lava and red-hot cinders, and burn up their
vineyards and perhaps injure their city; and
during the last two or three years many
people have been killed by earthquakes in
South America. These things seldom happen
in the North of Europe, and when they
do they are only slightly felt, and people are
not killed, neither are houses thrown down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Still, this shows that there must be some
great force underneath us, and very much
heat. We see nothing of this when we
look upon the green fields, and we should
scarcely think it possible if there were not
histories about these eruptions, as they are
called. But when I tell you that I have felt
the Earth tremble, and seen fire rushing out
from the top of a high mountain whose sides
were covered with snow, you will understand
how real it is—though it may seem so strange.</p>

<p>People at one time liked to fancy that
powerful spirits lived in volcanoes and made
them their workshops: but we know better
now.</p>

<p>Well, the interior of the Earth is evidently
very different from the part we live upon;
and it is the outside we have to think about
now, which would be dreadfully cold if the
sun did not shine upon it, though the inside
is so hot.</p>

<p>I have called this “the Geological Part,”
and the name Geological comes from two
Greek words meaning “a talk about the earth;”
but now you know it in its English dress it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
will be easy to recollect it. Geology is then the
study of the many kinds of rocks and fossils
which makeup our World, but we must know
something of the way in which they are placed.</p>

<p>You may have noticed, if you have made
many journeys to different parts of England
or Wales, that the rocks or soils are very
different in various places. Sometimes we
find numerous chalk-pits, as in parts of Kent,
or Sussex; if we go into Devonshire we may
notice the very red colour of the soil and of the
cliffs, especially near Sidmouth, Dawlish, and
Teignmouth; in North Wales we find great
quarries and hills of slate; while around
London we see a great deal of clay used for
making bricks, and called the London clay,
as well as many pits in gravel so useful for
making paths and mending roads, and in Kent
and Sussex chalk cliffs and hills are common.</p>

<p>Now after studying these various rocks
all over our country, we find that there is a
certain regular order in which they are found;
some have been made a long time before
others, and while most kinds contain some
fossils, those found in the oldest rocks are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
much less like the living plants and animals
than the fossils we find in the newer rocks.</p>

<p>But you will want to know how it is that
we can tell that one rock is older than
another, when both appear at the surface of
the earth. It would take a long time to
make sure of this for ourselves, but it will be
enough to say that the various cliffs, quarries,
and railway-cuttings often show one kind of
rock resting upon another, and these always
occur in a certain order. Thus we never find
the Chalk resting on the London Clay, but we
constantly find the London Clay resting on
the Chalk. And this is proved in another
way, by deep well-borings. Underneath
London many wells have been carried down
right through the London Clay, and if only
continued deep enough they always reach
the Chalk. In the same way, the order of
the other rocks has been ascertained in
different parts of the country, by examining
all the pits and quarries, and cliffs and cuttings,
with the help of what knowledge can
be obtained from deep mines and wells.</p>

<p>You will now begin to wonder why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
older rocks should appear at the surface. I
have told you about earthquakes, and you
will find that many dreadful earthquakes
must in former times have ravaged our
country. The reason why the old rocks
come to the surface is because they have
been lifted up sometimes violently, but more
often very slowly. And the newer rocks
which formerly rested on them have very
often been quite washed away, either by the
sea or by rivers and little streams which formerly
acted upon them.</p>

<p>Suppose then we take six books, some
thick and some thin, and pile them up together
on the table, the lowest being a good
thick one. The lowest we will call granite,
the next slate, the third sandstone, the fourth
coal, the fifth chalk, and the sixth the London
clay. These will represent some of the
principal kinds of earths, and you can fancy
many more with other names coming between
them; but the London clay can never be
below the granite nor the chalk below the
coal, for the great coal beds were formed long
before the chalk and clay. They generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
come in much the same order as we have
named them, hard rocks like granite at the
bottom, and softer earths, like sandstone, chalk
and clay, a long way above them. But we do
not always find all these earths in one place
even if we dig ever so deeply, though the
granite would always be found at the bottom
if we went deep enough.</p>

<p>Sometimes the granite and other old rocks
have been pushed through the upper layers
by some great force, and have broken
them and risen above them in magnificent
mountain chains, like those of the Andes in
South, and the Rocky Mountains in North
America, the Wicklow Mountains in Ireland,
the Grampians in Scotland, and the Cornish
mountains in England. We can easily suppose
that the lowest of our books (the granite
book) has been pushed upwards by some
great force from below, and parts of it broken
through the others, and raised high above
them; and this is what has actually been
done with real rocks. And as this kind of
upheaval has taken place at different periods
of the earths history, we find that granites
have come to the surface at different times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>When the layers are thus broken through
they are often tilted up on end and tumbled
about in confusion. But where there has
been no disturbance like this, they generally
rest evenly upon one another in their proper
order.</p>

<p>Granite, and rocks of the same kind, are
not in the least like chalk, or clay, or even
sandstone, and when once you have seen any
of these you will not be likely to mistake it
for the others. Granite is excessively hard,
and has a beautiful appearance when polished,
with a number of brilliant white and some
dark specks in it. It is used for paving the
streets of towns, for which purpose it is cut
into oblong blocks, and for the pillars of fine
buildings. Sometimes it is dark brown,
sometimes reddish, but generally a bluish
grey. This rock is composed of a great
quantity of crystals, and for this reason it is
thought it must have been melted at one
time by intense heat in the earth, and afterwards
slowly cooled. Chalk is very different,
and sandstone, though it is also hard, not in
the least like granite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>


<h3>HOW THE ROCKS WERE FORMED.</h3>

<p>What I have just said is about all that we
know of the formation of the oldest and hardest
granite rocks: but there is something going
on now which confirms the belief that the
materials of which they are made were melted
together by a greater heat than we can make
in our furnaces for melting iron; for I should
tell you that it is easier to melt iron and
copper than granite rocks. Volcanoes often
throw out melted earths which when cooled
appear to be made of much the same materials
as these granites.</p>


<h3>SANDSTONE.</h3>

<p>But we know more of the manner of the
formation of sandstone. This rock is composed
of rounded grains of sand just like that
we find upon the sea shore. If you take a
handful of this sand and squeeze it tightly,
it will keep together a little while. Now
suppose a quantity of this sand was pressed
by a very great weight—the weight of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
large hill for instance—after many years the
grains would stick firmly together, and become
a sort of stone. It is in this way the
sandstones must have been formed, and perhaps
heat helped the work, though not so
great a heat as melted the granite. The
sand, after it had been washed upon the sea
shore, became gradually covered with other
earths hundreds of feet thick, and the immense
weight above it pressed it into stone:
but you may imagine how very long a time
it took to do this. Sandstones are used for
building, but they do not last very long; the
frost makes little cracks in them and they
soon crumble away to the grains of sand of
which they were made. Several fossils are
found in some of these sandstones, which
have been formed at many different periods
of the earth’s history.</p>


<h3>CHALK.</h3>

<p>You have seen those high cliffs of chalk
along the south coast of England, perhaps,
and you have wondered what that beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
white earth was, and how it came there. It
is found in many parts of the world, and
the south and south-east of England are to a
great extent composed of it. The material
is called by chemists carbonate of lime. It
is almost entirely made up of minute shells
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">foraminifera</i>, from two Latin words
which mean that there are many openings or
chambers in their shells, and there are many
beautiful fossils called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ammonites</i> imbedded in
the chalk. These are shell-fish, two or three
inches, and sometimes a foot across, and their
shape is very like that of the young leaves of
the common fern before it has opened in the
spring.</p>

<p>Millions of these tiny foraminifera are
living now in parts of the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans, and when they die their shells sink
to the bottom and form a greyish mud, something
like chalk.</p>

<p>When H.M.S. “Challenger” was sent out
in the year 1873, to find out what was at the
bottom of the deepest seas of the World,
great interest was felt in the expedition,
because we were sure that we should learn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
something about the manner in which some
of the rocks were formed.</p>

<p>We knew that the whole of the beds of
the present seas must be receiving the washings
of the rivers and the bodies of many
fishes and animals, and that the rocks of the
future must be forming down there by these
accumulations. Long lines were let down from
the ship with a dredge at the end, and thus
parts of the bottom of the sea were brought
up and carefully examined. It was found
that the washings, stones, clay, and mud of
the land were carried hundreds of miles out
to sea, and laid upon the bottom. But in the
deeper parts, where the Alps would be almost
covered—there was a fine grey mud composed
almost entirely of the shells of the
little foraminifera, and this, no doubt, is the
chalk of future times, or perhaps limestone
of a harder kind. Deeper, too, than where
this grey mud is found, there is a reddish
mud, exceedingly fine and soft. We cannot
exactly say yet whether this is formed from
the remains of shell-fish; but it is, at all
events, very like the clay of the land, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
some future time will most likely become like
that stiff mud we know so well. So that
even the materials for bricks are being made
now, and perhaps when all those hundreds
of islands scattered about the Pacific Ocean
are joined into one great Continent, this red
mud will be raised and made use of for building
the houses of new peoples and nations.</p>

<p>When we see this going on now, of course
it is very easy to conclude that the chalk, a
great deal of which is above the sea now,
must have been formed in the same way at the
bottom of an ancient ocean, and afterwards
raised by the same kind of upward force which
made the granite break through other earths.</p>

<p>If we did not know that the same cause was
at work now, and that the same kinds of shell-fish
were living and laying down new beds of
chalk under the sea, we should not know
how to account for the quantities of chalk in
the world. For innumerable ages these little
creatures have thus been paving the floor of
the ocean with their dead bodies, and you
may suppose that countless millions of them
must have lived and died! In some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
chalks the shells of the foraminifera can be
quite distinctly seen with a microscope, and
when these are compared with the shells of
living ones, they are seen to be almost exactly
alike. Next time you pass through one of the
railway cuttings through the chalk in going to
Brighton, or Ramsgate, or Dover, remember
that those high cliffs were built up by these
Liliputian giants under the sea, and you may
think of the chalk as “foraminifera earth”.</p>


<h3>COAL.</h3>

<p>You see this black shining substance
almost every day, and you know it is dug up
from very deep pits where the poor miners are
often killed by explosions of gas escaping
from it. But it is as well to know what
it is and how it comes to be so useful to us.
In the language of chemistry it is called
“carbon”, and a great writer has given it the
poetical name of “compressed sunlight”. But
you will ask how sunlight could possibly
get into a deep mine, and how it could be
compressed there. You will see that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
explanation is really quite simple by-and-by.
This coal was once above ground, and was
a splendid forest of waving palm-trees, and
ferns, and gigantic mosses, as you will see by
the pictures of the fossils of them.</p>

<p>Many of the animals and plants of past
times were giants compared to those living
now, of the same species or kind, and many
of the plants of the present time are dwarfs
to those of the same kind which formed the
coal beds. Many generations of trees must
have grown and died, and others must have
sprung up, and so on, until beds of them,
some ten, others twenty, or even thirty feet
thick, were formed. Here, buried in the
coal, are the stems, leaves, bark, roots, fruit,
and seeds of these trees, and we can have no
doubt that almost the whole of the coal is
composed of them. You must not expect to
find the shapes of these in every piece of coal
you may happen to look at, because most of
it has been greatly changed by the great
weight and pressure upon it, and the length
of time: but it is certainly all the same substance—wood
turned into coal. The fossil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
plants of the coal are of course entirely
black, but there is no mistake about their
having once been living plants.</p>

<p>You will ask perhaps how the coal came
to be buried so deep. It is not so always,
being sometimes at the surface. But just as
the granite has been pushed up through the
other rocks, so has the coal in some places
been uplifted and in others has sunk down.
It was often covered up by other earths to
a great depth, after the trees which composed
it had died; but where it is now at
the surface these newer earths have been
afterwards worn away. When the sun shone
upon these coal trees they took its warmth
and light into their stems and leaves, for they
could not live without, and this made them
grow so fast and become so large that it is
not untrue to call coal “compressed sunlight.”
Charcoal is in some respects so like coal that
it would seem to you at once that they were
probably the same material. Charcoal is
simply burnt wood, and when the coal forests
had died down, and when these beds sank
down beneath other layers the pressure and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
heat together turned the wood and leaves
into a hard mass like charcoal in colour, but
heavier and more solid, and just enough of the
stems and leaves have been left to enable
us to know with certainty that coal was once
wood.</p>

<p>We light our fires now and drive our
steam-engines with the heat of the sun which
shone upon the coal forests, and has been
stored up for many thousands of years in the
Earth, to be brought out once more to give
us light and warmth.</p>


<h3>CLAY AND MUD.</h3>

<p>While the ancient forests were growing
up to form the coal beds, and the foraminifera
were slowly building up the chalk, as I
have explained, the Earth was covered with
water in some places which are now dry land,
and the sea now flows over parts of the
World which were once the habitations of
plants and animals. These great changes
have left their marks upon many a mountain
side, and many an old river or sea bed has
become filled up. A map of Europe during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
the chalk period would show that the places
where Paris, London, Copenhagen, and Berlin
now are were then under the ocean; but
since then these places have been lifted up,
and mud, clay, and gravel swept over the
chalk in many places by the action of new
rivers and seas. Water, you perceive, has
had a great deal to do with these changes,
and indeed it is one of Nature’s most powerful
tools, for it can wash down rocks and
cliffs and cut its way in rivers for thousands
of miles over the Earth’s surface. It carries
down mud, and clay, and gravel, and this
soil, which has been named alluvium, is one
of the most interesting of all to us, because it
contains the bones of the immense animals we
shall talk about presently, as well as those of
the oldest races of men with their weapons
and ornaments.</p>

<p>The mud age, and we are in the mud
and gravel age now, belongs to what is called
the Tertiary period, and we shall see that
this age has lasted a very long time already,
so long that though it is still going on, the
most extraordinary animals have lived and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
died, and not one of them is now left alive.
Still the same washing and cutting of water is
going on which buried their bones in swamps,
and bogs, and river caves, and may perhaps
carry away some of the bones of us who are
living now, to be found ages afterwards by
future generations who will read our history
in these silent witnesses, as we read the history
of the tree ferns and foraminifera in the coal
and the chalk.</p>

<p>The present age of the World’s history
is the Mud age, or, as we shall call it in future,
the Tertiary period, and I think you will agree
with me when I come to describe it, that it
contains the most interesting of all the pieces
of “the puzzle of life.”</p>

<p>The earth of the Tertiary period is very
different from a great many of the older
earths. Clay, mud, and gravel are the washings
only of the older rocks, the fine particles
which have been worn off from them
by frost and water and carried down by
rivers and left in large beds, and sometimes
they have a good deal of decayed wood and
weeds mixed with them. Here are found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
the bones of the great animals which were so
much larger and stronger than those of the
same kind living now, or any that lived
before them.</p>


<h3>UPHEAVAL AND DEPRESSION.</h3>

<p>These two words are so often used in
books on geology that we shall not be able
to get on without knowing their meaning. We
have seen that the rocks have been formed
in a certain way—some by heat, some by
water, and some by dead forests—and
that they lie over one another in pretty
regular order. But this order has sometimes
been disturbed and the layers have been
tumbled about among one another very
much. In some places the older rocks, such
as granite, slate, and sandstone, have been
pushed up through those above, and in
others the coal has sunk down and been
covered with thick layers of chalk, sand, and
mud. When the force below pushes a layer
up through the others it is called <em>upheaval</em>,
and when a layer sinks down it is called
<em>depression</em>, or <em>subsidence</em>. Both these actions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
are going on now in different parts of the
Earth. A great part of Sweden, Norway,
and Denmark, of Spitzbergen, Siberia, and
the north of America, is being slowly raised
higher above the sea, as we know by the
height their old sea beaches now are above
the water; while part of the shore of
America opposite to Europe and also the
south of Greenland is slowly sinking down,
as we know by the remains of land animals
and trees which are now covered by the
tide; and at many places on the coast
of India this subsidence is also going on.
Nearer home, too, there is an example
of it in the island of Guernsey. All round
the coast of this island, like that of Jersey, are
found tree trunks and other remains of old
forest land beneath the water. Old histories
refer to this as dry land; and if a map
of it made in 1406 is correct, this land must
have sunk about 150 feet since that time.</p>

<p>Thus we can see, even at the present
time, the very same changes which have
worked upon our Earth for innumerable
ages. It is now easy to understand how the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
forests which must have grown above in the
air have, after a long time, sunk down to a
great depth, and been turned into coal, and
covered with the sediment, sand, gravel,
and chalk from the seas which afterwards
flowed over the places where they grew.</p>

<p>Sometimes the rocks by the sea shore are
cut into terraces or steps by the constant
wear of the water, and when we see these
water marks far above the present level of the
sea we know that the land must have been
lifted up gradually above the sea. There are
many such terraces in Norway. To prove
whether this is so marks have been cut upon
rocks at a measured height above the sea,
and after some years these marks have been
noticed to have been raised much above
the water by the “upheaval” of the earth at
that place.</p>

<p>Generally this change of level has taken
place gradually, and the greatest work in
moving the layers of earth and displacing
them has been very slow. But in some places
violent and sudden shocks have happened,
tearing up the rocks and piling them up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
heaps; and now and then islands have suddenly
appeared in the sea and vanished out
of sight completely in a short time. Islands
have thus come up in the Mediterranean Sea
within the memory of man. In the year 1831
the island of Julia suddenly appeared near the
coast of Sicily, and since the year 186 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> no
less than three islands have started up in the
bay of the island of Santorin. In this century
islands have appeared among the Azores, the
Indian Archipelago, the Philippines, the
Moluccas, and on the coast of Kamtschatka
and other places. Some of these have appeared
suddenly, others slowly, and they no
doubt have been raised by a great force from
below.</p>

<p>You will see now how easy it is to account
for the changes of the places of the layers of
rock. The same thing is going on now which
has been going on throughout all time, only
perhaps with more energy formerly than now,
making mountains, islands, and continents,
raising up a large tract of land in one place
and sinking an island or a sea shore in
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>These changes have been of great use to
us too. Suppose all England had been covered
with coal or slate, we should not have been
able to grow anything! As it is we have
sand and gravel in one county, chalk in
another, slate or granite in another, and coal
down below in several, and we can grow a
great variety of plants on all these different
soils. We have to thank “upheaval” and
“depression” for this. The force which is
always working below us has turned up the
different soils like a gigantic plough, and
brought some to the top and covered others,
so that instead of having to dig down deeper
than ever we have yet, we have only to go
from one county to another to find the
different rocks. We know that we could not
get at the coal in Sussex without going down
an unknown depth through the chalk and
other earths, but we dig for it in the North
of England, where we know its depth below
the surface.</p>

<p>I will try now to give you some idea of
the way in which the rocks come in their
order, or the succession of formations as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
geologists call it. If we started to walk from
Wales to London the rocks we should pass
over would be—slate and flagstones in
Wales, and going on towards London, limestone,
old red sandstone, more limestones,
coal beds, new red sandstone, oolite, greensand,
chalk, and last London clay. We
might not always find each of these near the
surface, but they would be found to be the
principal rocks on a line between Wales and
London, the oldest being in Wales and the
newest or most recent as we get nearer
London. That word “oolite” which I used
comes from two Greek words meaning “roe”
and “stone,” because the rock is composed of
little rounded grains of a chalky substance
shaped like the hard roe of a fish, or like
sago before it is cooked.</p>

<p>If you look at the following table you will
see how the principal rocks are placed one
upon the other, beginning at the lowest or
oldest at the bottom and going up to the
newest at the top of the table, and on the
right hand side I have written the names of
the principal fossils which each kind of earth
contains.</p>

<p>If you read this table upwards from the
bottom you will notice that life began in a
very small way with Eozöon (the “life-dawn
animal”), that fishes appeared afterwards, that
the wonderful forests of the coal period then
grew and were covered up by other rocks
and pressed into solid coal, that numbers of
great crocodile-like animals lived all through
the oolite time, how the deep wide beds
of chalk were laid down by humble foraminifera,
and when we get to the recent
newest beds of gravel, mud, sand, clay, &amp;c.,
the sweepings by water of the older rocks
ground down by ages of wear and tear, we
have the mammoth, mastodon, megatherium,
and other great vegetable eaters, and lastly
Man himself with his simple weapons of
stone, bone, and horn—our early forefathers.</p>

<p>You must always keep in mind that the
greatest of these changes have taken place
very slowly. Mountains have been raised,
and whole continents have been sunk by
movements so slow that if the hands of a
clock went only once round the dial in a year
the hand would go faster than these mountains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
have risen or the continents sunk. Almost
always whenever there has been sudden and
<em>violent</em> action it has been near volcanoes or
during earthquakes; but these things, terrible
as they are to the people living near, disturb
only a very small part of the surface, and
such violence neither buried the coal beds
nor raised the slate hills of Wales. Many of
the small effects of the internal force of the
earth have been sudden and violent, but the
greatest and grandest have been slower than
anything we can imagine.</p>

<p>If this had not been so, we should not
find fossil shells just as they sank quietly to
the bottom of ancient seas, quite undisturbed.
We should not find delicate ferns and insects
with all their breakable parts perfectly preserved,
and as lightly laid as if you had
put them away carefully in a cabinet upon
cotton wool. Yet many of these have sunk
down hundreds of feet below the open air
where they <em>must</em> have lived. We find the
ripple marks of the waves on old sandstones,
and even the prints of the feet of birds and
animals as they walked upon that rock when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
it was soft sand, and the little pits made
by rain-drops on the moist earth. All this
speaks of stillness, and gentle movement, no
violence. So slowly and softly have these
rocks settled down, that we can read in them
the history of the life that was. But if there
had been any sudden and rough movement
all these fossils might have been broken up
and we should have had nothing but fragments,
and the “puzzle of life” could never
have been put together. Nature’s forces are
immense, but they work slowly, irresistibly,
and majestically.</p>


<h3>THE ICE AGE.</h3>

<p>We have seen now what the principal rocks
are made of and the way in which their places
have been changed by upheaval and depression.
Water, as we know, has been at work
and has done great things in <em>all</em> ages of the
World’s history. I have called it “one of
Nature’s most powerful tools,” and when we
look at the quantity of chalk alone that there
is in the world, and remember that this was all
laid down in water, and perhaps a great part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
of its lime carried down by rivers to the seas
where it settled to the bottom, after the
corals and small shell-fish had worked it into
their bodies, we are right in thinking water
a great Magician indeed. Why, even so
small a river as the Thames carries down to
the sea every year as much dissolved earth
as would make a good large hill; and what
must such rivers as the Nile, the Amazon,
the Mississippi, and the great Chinese rivers
do! There must have been gigantic rivers,
too, in the old times, or else it would have
been impossible that the deep sandstone and
slate beds could have been formed; for these
are all laid down by the washing away of
earth in water.</p>

<p>Ice, which is only solid water, has also
been a powerful tool in shaping the surface
of the Earth, but it has not been <em>always</em> at
work as water has. Ice now covers only a
comparatively small part of the globe near the
north and south poles, and mountains like
those in Switzerland; but by watching what
ice is doing now in these places we are able
to be certain that there has been a time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
it covered Scotland, Cumberland, Wales,
Sweden and Norway, and nearly all North
America. In watching the great “rivers of
ice,” called glaciers, in the Alps, for instance,
we see that they slip down from the mountains
slowly, creeping on year by year, and
bringing with them pieces of rock and stones.
We see also where they have melted that they
have been grinding the rocks beneath them
with their great weight, and have cut grooves
into, and scraped and polished the hardest
granite. The stones underneath the glaciers
have been pressed so heavily upon the rocks
that they have left deep marks, and we find
the same kinds of marks and heaps of stones
in many mountains where there are no
glaciers now. There are other things too
which convince us that a great ice sheet
spread over almost the whole of Great Britain.
When the huge icebergs break away from
the frozen shores of Greenland and North
America, they often have frozen into their
ice large blocks of rock, sand, gravel, &amp;c.,
and when they drift into the warmer seas of
the south they melt, and of course these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
blocks or “boulders,” as they are called, sink
to the bottom. Just the same kind of boulders
are found in many parts of the world,
where icebergs never come now, and as they
are of a different rock from that on which
they lie, they must have been brought there
somehow. We naturally suppose then that
they were brought by icebergs. Sometimes
boulders of granite have been found thus
among clay, many miles from where there
are any granite rocks on the surface, and
there can be no doubt that they were originally
frozen into an iceberg, which floated away
with them and when it melted left them so far
from their native place. In many of the midland
and eastern counties once floated these
icebergs, dropping the stones and boulders
which they brought away from the Welsh,
Cumberland, and Scottish mountains.</p>

<p>The climate of the earth must have been
fearfully cold when our country was covered
with ice, just as Greenland is now. Geologists
suppose that there must have been more
than one age of ice, and that between these
ages the climate of the world was pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
much the same as at present, although it is
certain that there were periods when England
was much warmer, because many of
the fossil plants could not have grown in a
cold climate.</p>

<p>You will want to know whether there
were any land animals living during the ice
periods. It is impossible to be quite certain,
but it is most likely that the mammoth was
living both before and during the <em>last</em> ice age,
because its bones have been found among
the earths brought down by the glaciers.</p>

<p>I have said all you will be likely to remember
at present about the nature of the
different rocks, but it will help you to understand
better how they have been laid one
upon the other, and how they have been
moved and broken by upheaval and subsidence,
if you look at the drawings on
page <a href="#i_p051-1">51</a>.</p>


<h3>DENUDATION.</h3>

<p>It has often happened that some of the
harder and older rocks, like granite and
slate, have pushed themselves through those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
earths lying above them, and then the sea
or a great river has washed away all the
earths from one side of the rock. The rain,
too, falling for thousands of years, has swept
them down into the valleys and mixed them
together. This is called denudation, or
“laying bare” the harder rocks by washing
the softer ones away from them. Those
beds of pebbles on the sea shore also have
been battering against the rocks for ages and
very gradually wearing them away, as you
can see if you watch the stones being
driven into and sucked out of holes and
cracks by every wave. Thus, both the
loose stones and the solid rocks get polished
and ground away, and Nature is always
destroying and making again by turns. If
this destruction went on continually without
any raising of the land to make up for it, the
surface of the whole Earth would in time
become level; but old sea beds are always
being slowly raised above the water and
prepared for the growth of plants and the
habitation of animals.</p>

<p>If you watch the little rills of water on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>any rainy day, trickling down a hill, or the
springs which bubble up at the foot of cliffs
on the sea shore, you will see an example of
denudation in a small way. The earth is
washed off the surface here and there, and
carried down and laid up in banks in some
places, and the harder ground underneath is
laid bare. Little beds of stones are collected
in one place, and sticks and straws and such
light things in another, and this is just what
has been done on a large scale in mountain
regions, all over the world for many centuries.</p>

<p>In the uppermost sketch on page <a href="#i_p051-1">51</a> you
will see how the granite has been lifted
up with the layers of other earth along its
sides, and afterwards even layers have been
deposited above; in the second there has
been a great crack in the land, and a great
mass of rock has subsided, and the hollow has
become filled up in time with clay, and mould,
and rich soil, so that some one has built a
house and made a garden on it; in the third
the river has cut a gorge in rocks which were
once continuous from cliff to cliff, wearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
away the softer earths more easily than the
harder. If the Earth was cut into in different
places we should find the rocks arranged in a
very similar way to that in the three sketches.</p>


<h3>BOILING SPRINGS, ETC.</h3>

<p>In several different countries there are
very strange sights, but scarcely anything
is more astonishing than the fountains of
boiling water which shoot up out of the
ground. There are a good many of them
not far from us, in Iceland, and many
hundreds in Wyoming in America, and they
are called “geysers.” Steam and boiling
water, and sometimes mud, are thrown up by
these natural fountains to a height of 200 feet—as
high as the top of the spire of a church.
The water must come from a great depth
in the ground—perhaps many thousand feet
down—where the heat is intense. This water
springing up with clouds of snow-white steam,
and falling all round in showers, has a most
beautiful appearance. These geysers now and
then throw out very little water, just bubbling
up above the ground, and then travellers boil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
eggs and chickens and such things in them,
and have a pic-nic near them. It is impossible
to say how long they have lasted,
but we know from history that some have
been spouting out water for at least 2,000
years, and how much longer no one can tell.
They may have something to do with volcanoes,
because water may have found its
way to the heated interior of the earth, and
being converted into steam, expands and
causes an eruption.</p>

<p>Now that we have some idea of the construction
of the Earth, we must go on to the
<em>life</em> of the wonderful plants and creatures
which have peopled it.</p>

<h3>THE DAWN OF LIFE.</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first beams of the rising sun, and the
first grey light of the morning, tell us of the
coming day; but we cannot even think of
the dawn of that far-off day in the Earth’s
history, when no voice of man or beast was
heard, and no trees or grass covered it, without
solemn wonder at the immense distance
that day is from us. A thousand ages are
in the sight of the Creator but as yesterday,
and the period of man’s existence is only
a moment compared to that of the lowly
creatures which built up this World for him.
In the first seas and on the land nothing was
heard but the rushing of waters and the roaring
of the fires of volcanoes.</p>

<p>It is impossible to be quite certain
whether the first living things were animals
or plants; but I think it most likely that
very simple plants grew first, and that very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
simple animals came after or with them.
Among the first of these, or perhaps the very
first, were some small animals called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eozöon</i>,
which means the “life-dawn animal,” and
with them grew some simple plants. On the
banks of the St. Lawrence river in Canada
there is a great bed of rock called the
Laurentian rocks, made almost entirely of
the tiny remains of the “life-dawn animal,”
which, when we look at them through a microscope,
are found to possess nearly the same
structure as some lowly organized shells
living in the seas now. These rocks are
found in many parts of the world besides—in
Eastern America, Bavaria, Scotland, and
Norway; and in some places their thickness
has been estimated at thirty thousand feet, or
nearly six miles, or one hundred times as
thick as St. Paul’s Cathedral is high! These
little creatures you see were at work over
a great part of the Earth’s surface, and you
may fancy how many thousands of thousands
of years it took them to build up these rocks.
The “life-dawn animal” is far older than the
chalk-building foraminifera, and so far as we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
know it lived alone in its seas. There were
none of the beautiful twisted <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ammonite</i> shell-fish,
nor the shark-like fishes of the chalk
seas. The eozöon was the only kind of
living creature, the “lord of creation” for the
time; and though storms raged in the seas
it inhabited, the water was so deep that it
lived on undisturbed. When you are able
to use a microscope you will be able to see
the traces left by these tiny animals in what
is now hard stone.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Life began in a very small way: there
were none of the great land animals we
have now; but these seemingly insignificant
builders were at work so long that they
made the immense rocks I have told you of.
But this is not all. About this time some
very simple plants grew on the land, and
were carried down by the rivers and formed
deep beds. After a long time these became
covered up with different earths and were
turned into the substance called “black-lead,”
which you use in drawing pencils. But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
is not really lead; it is almost pure carbon—in
fact, the oldest kind of coal—so old that it
will not now burn like coal, and is entirely
made up of fossil plants crushed out of shape,
so that we cannot now trace their forms, as
we can the plants of the coal. When then
you next take up a drawing pencil it will
be easy to remember that the black substance
which marks the paper was once a
living plant, now changed by heat and pressure
into almost pure carbon. As the name
eozöon has been given to the “life-dawn
animal,” I will give this black-lead the name
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eodendron</i>, or the “dawn-plant.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Two very simple forms of life then
occupied the earth and sea at the earliest
time when anything at all was living, and
strangely enough we use the dead bodies of
both of them. We build houses of the rocks
the eozöon laid down at the bottom of the
sea, and the beautiful art of drawing is carried
on with the carbon from the first plant
life of the world—the eodendron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>I must take you away presently to the
coal, and sandstone, and chalk, and show you
how plants and animals gradually increased
in number and size, and fishes began to
inhabit the seas, and all living things were
slowly going on to greater perfection; for as
time went on there was a steady progress
from creatures like the eozöon, which had
scarcely any power of moving about, to the
active, quarrelsome and greedy things like
crabs and lobsters which came after them,
and the gigantic ferns of the coal beds.
The peaceful “life-dawn animals” drew their
food from the vegetable substances dissolved
in the waters, though they perhaps also lived
on animals still smaller than themselves; but,
by-and-by, creatures, which must have been
monsters to them, swarmed in the seas and
devoured their smaller companions wholesale;
and in time the Earth became very much the
same as it is now, a place where the struggle
for life is always going on. It is certain that
animals have fed upon one another from the
very beginning; but this is no doubt a wise
law of the Creator to prevent them from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
increasing too fast, as they would do if all that
were born lived, and none were destroyed.</p>

<p>We know much less about the vegetation—the
plants and grasses—of the early ages
of the world than of the animals; because
plants rot away faster than bones and shells,
and, besides, are less likely to be found in
places where they would be preserved. A
dead tree might be eaten up entirely by
insects, as the white ants eat up fallen trees
in a short time in tropical countries, and
what is left of them crumbles away to fine
powder and mixes with the soil. Immense
trees are thus devoured now by millions of
tiny insects no longer than your thumb nail,
in India and Australia. No such thing as a
whole and perfect fossil tree with every twig
and leaf has been found; but then the coal
beds are really great forests which have been
buried for so long a time that they have
quite altered in appearance. Still, among
these coal beds we often find the bark, fruit,
stems, and branches of trees very much like
firs, and ferns, and huge club-mosses, which
have the same shape they had when living,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
though they are quite black, and burn exactly
like coal.</p>

<p>But there were plants long before the
coal forests lived, and many fossil sea weeds
are found in the old sandstones and limestones
in Wales and other places.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Old
Red Sandstone, whose position you can see
below the coal in the table of succession of
formations, page <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, does not give us many
fossil plants, though fishes and shells are
common. This rock is found in Scotland,
Herefordshire, Devonshire, and Ireland, as
well as other places, and is often more than
2,000 feet thick. It was not all formed in
salt water we know, because many of the fossil
fishes and shells it contains are fresh water
kinds. It must all have been made of the
pieces of still older rocks worn away by
rivers and settled like a sediment in immense
lakes, some of which were fresh water. Then,
after the Old Red Sandstone, came a time
when the limestones below the coal were
laid down at the bottom of a vast sea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
here the remains of land plants are of course
few. Then it seems there must have been
a very long time when there were large
continents all over the world raised above
the seas, but not very much, and on these
the forests grew which afterwards became
coal fields. Until this time the plants had
been mostly water weeds, reeds, rushes, and
sea weeds, and it was not until England and
Ireland became one continent, as they were
once and covered with woods, that the great
period of vegetation began.</p>

<p>The growth of plants was then most
wonderful; but although coal is found in
many different parts of the world, it was not
all formed at one time, and though it is
plentiful in England and Wales, Scotland,
Ireland, France, Belgium, Russia, Hungary,
Australia, New Zealand, China, and Borneo,
it is older in some countries than in others.
It is fortunate, however, that this useful
material was made in Nature’s workshop in
so many different countries, or it would have
to be carried from one to another. The coal
forests were not the same trees as we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
now—oaks, elms, ashes, limes, and so on.
Most of them had rather hollow trunks and
splendid waving tops like ferns and reeds,
though there were some like our fir-trees.</p>

<p>If you lie down in the long grass before
it is mown, and look through the stalks
and fancy yourself an inch high only, you
will have some idea how the coal forest
would have looked if you had lived then.
But there were no human beings on the
Earth then, and I do not think there were
any large animals, at least none have been
found in the coal itself, except in Switzerland,
where a few bones of the mammoth
(an ancient elephant) and of the rhinoceros
have been discovered in the much newer
beds of coal, and also those of a large reptile
like a crocodile in the coal beds of Ohio
in America.</p>

<br>

<p>In such immense forests insects must
certainly have been plentiful, and some of
the fossil bodies of beetles, dragon-flies, and
spiders, have been preserved, and a few tree
lizards.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Of course the edges of the coal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>forests were washed here and there by the
salt sea, and there must have been some fresh
water rivers and ponds, for we find both fresh
and salt water shells in these beds. It was
almost dark in these forests, so thickly did the
plants grow together. There were enormous
club-mosses close together and as high as most
houses, with their leaves interlaced making a
complete network to shut out the sun. But
the sun which shone on the forests was warm,
and the air which went through them was soft,
or they would not have grown so wonderfully.
Indeed, there can be no doubt that the
climate of northern regions was once much
warmer than it is now. A thick bed of coal
was discovered by the Arctic Expedition
in 1875-6 actually within five hundred miles
of the North Pole, where the ice on the sea
is now thirty or forty feet thick!<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
forest which formed this coal could only have
grown in a temperate climate, and there are
no forests there now; it is so intensely cold
they could not live. There must then have
been a great change in the climate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Arctic regions since that coal was living vegetation.
The few plants and mosses which
can live there now are of a very different
and more hardy kind than those of the coal
forests.</p>

<p>If you look at the engraving facing page <a href="#i_p065-1">64</a>,
you will see a drawing of one of the tree
ferns with its delicate fronds which grew
so abundantly in the coal forests, and there
are many other plants, some like the common
“mare’s tails,” or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">calamites</i>, growing in shallow
ponds and ditches now—only the “mare’s
tails” or calamites of the coal forests were as
high as poplars.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> You can imagine what a
splendid sight these forests of ferns, club-mosses,
and “mare’s tails,” must have been,
and what a multitude of beautiful insects and
butterflies must have flitted about in them;
but their frail bodies have almost all perished,
so that we know very little of the animated
creatures of the time.</p>

<p>Besides several sorts of coal both soft and
hard there is a substance called “lignite,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
which is scarcely wood and scarcely coal, of a
brown colour. In fact, lignite is wood almost
turned to coal, and it has helped us to learn
that coal was once living wood; but it is not
nearly so old as the coal. Then again there
is the beautiful substance called “jet” used for
making bracelets. This is a kind of fossil
gum or pitch dropped from the trees while
they were growing, and, though different in
colour, it is much the same in kind as amber.
Amber is often found with flies, spiders, and
small leaves imbedded in it. When this fossil
resin or gum was flowing out of the ancient
pine-trees, and was quite sticky, flies settled
upon it and became entangled in it, and as
more of the gum flowed out they became
quite covered. Then the gum dropped from
the tree and hardened, and it is now found in
lumps on the shores of the Baltic Sea, and in
beds of sand and clay with fossil wood. It is
of a beautiful bright yellow colour, and beads
for necklaces and other ornaments are made
out of it.</p>

<p>If we arrange the things we have been
talking about in order, the oldest first, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
would come thus: plumbago or black-lead—or,
as I have called it, eodendron, “the life-dawn
plant”—first, then hard coal, then soft
coal, then lignite and jet, then bog oak and
peat. But I must tell you something about
bog oak and peat. In many of the swamps
and bogs of the World the trunks of dead
trees are found, which have become quite
black and almost like lignite, because they
have been buried so long. Thus, in the bogs
of Ireland oak trees are often found, and they
were most likely living when the reindeer inhabited
Ireland. This old bogwood is made
into beads for necklaces and other ornaments.
Peat is a partly decayed vegetable substance,
with beautiful little plants growing on its surface,
and is really coal in its infancy. It is found
all over the world more or less in wet places,
and consists of the roots and stems of mosses
and reeds, some of which are like the gigantic
plants of the coal period, but very small in
comparison. I have no doubt that in time
some of these peat bogs may be turned into
coal if they sink down and become covered
with other earths, but at present they are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
on the surface and so soft that they are dangerous
to walk upon because one may sink
in and be smothered.</p>

<p>This, as far as we can trace it, is a sketch
of the history of vegetable life on our Earth.
We will go back to the coal for a moment and
see what the animal life of that time was.
The seas of the time of the coal forests were
sometimes shallow, sometimes deep, and in
the limestone rocks of the oceans which
separated the great continents of that time
there is a record of the inhabitants of the
seas. The land plants were of more than
1,000 different kinds, and there were more
than 200 kinds of fishes in the waters, and
corals, shells, and small crab-like animals innumerable.
The fishes were fellows with
terrible teeth, and their bodies were covered
with strong hard scales. One of these fish
was thirty feet long, and there were others
of considerable size. It is curious that the
fishes of this time remind one of reptiles
(lizards and crocodiles), just as the birds of
a future time seem to have something of the
reptile about them, as you will see by-and-by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>I dare say you have remarked while
reading that all the plants and animals of the
early ages of the world seem to be made on
a simple plan, and as the Earth grows older
they become more perfect, and this is just
what I want you to take notice of all through.
The plants of the coal period, you have seen,
were nothing like so perfect in construction,
beautiful as they were, as the forest trees of
the present time, neither were the animals
so perfect as those living now. There has
been <em>progress</em>, step by step, throughout the
vegetable and animal creation; and, though
many of the lower forms of the early ages
exist now, there are others far superior to
them which did not exist then: but all this
will come in “The Animal Part.”</p>

<p>About the middle of the Earth’s age came
the wonderful period of vegetation which
gave us our coal, and after that there was a
great and busy time, when huge reptiles and
reptile-like birds, and then true birds, made
their appearance. But that belongs to the
next part of the “puzzle of life.”</p>

<p>If we look with astonishment at the coal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
forests, we may also well think of them with
thankfulness. Here is the sunshine of past
ages stored up for our use, and we bring it
out again to warm ourselves, cook our food,
make all our iron things, and drive our steam-engines!
Can any romance be finer than
this, that we are carried across to America
and India and Australia in steam-boats driven
by the “fossil sunlight” of ages and ages past,
and whirled along at sixty miles an hour over
iron rails by the same stored-up strength?</p>

<p>If you doubt this, think of living trees. Do
they not live by the air and sunlight? Will
they grow without these? They spread
their branches and leaves to gather the
warmth and light from the air, and when
they are cut down and dried, and you put a
match to the wood, all the old warmth and
light come out again; and we know that
the coal is only fossil wood. Our Creator
wastes nothing. Even when there were no
people living to rejoice in the sun, He
thought of those people who <em>should</em> come in
time, and not one of the fiery rays of the
fierce sun was lost. These mighty forests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
were sent to gather it, and when they had
died down they sank below the surface and
were covered from the air, that none of their
light or heat should escape.</p>

<p>In such forests it is strange that there
were no birds, especially as there were swarms
of insects, and no doubt abundance of worms.
But no bone of bird or any trace of feathered
songster of these lovely groves has yet been
found. Little lizards chased flies and beetles
up and down the stems of the club-mosses and
ferns, and larger reptiles lurked in the long
damp grass under the shade. The pools and
ponds were filled with curious fishes, and
reefs of beautiful white coral fringed all the
shores of the seas.</p>

<p>But the Earth was not fit for the habitation
of man. The fruits of the trees were not such
as he could have eaten, and their wood was
not hard enough to build houses of. Still it
was being got ready for him, and not a leaf
waved uselessly in the bright, warm air, and
not a tree fell to the ground, but it was to be
turned into coal, and to come forth again one
day a hard black lump, without any of its
former beauty, but to give back the light and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
heat it had gathered from the sun ages and
ages ago.</p>

<p>Many periods in the Earth’s history have
passed since the coal period, and in every
one of these the trees have been increasing
in perfection, though there have never since
been such great numbers of a few kinds
growing. When we come to the more lately
formed beds of earth we begin to find the
cypress, willow, ash, oak, elm, and other
forest trees which are living now. The
trunks of these trees, blackened by age, lie
buried in peat bogs and swamps all over
Europe. The mighty Mississippi river brings
down immense quantities of dead trees, and
as these sink to the bottom near its mouth
they are forming future coal beds. Along
the coast of Norfolk and Suffolk, too, and
stretching far away under the German
Ocean, is an old English forest. In some
places the trunks of the buried trees may
be seen standing upright just where they
grew. The nets of the fishermen are continually
bringing up pieces of wood, roots,
and seeds; and when the sea washes away
the soft cliffs here the bones, teeth, and tusks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
of the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
and other large animals which inhabited this
forest, may be seen in great numbers.</p>

<p>Down below the waves of ocean have
these woods sunk with all their once living
creatures, and though you may suppose that
it must have been very long ago that they
grew, they are of the same kind as those
which now make the hills and valleys of
England beautiful.</p>

<p>Sometimes a forest must sink very fast,
for travellers have told us how they have
sailed on rivers and lakes over the tops of
sunken trees, and, looking down into the
clear water, have seen the branches waving
below—tall trees standing upright at the
bottom, and the boats sailing over their tops!</p>

<p>We must now pass on to the living creatures
which peopled the Earth, and their
story can be told with more certainty than
that of the perishable plants which clothed
the surface of the ground, and, while they
rendered it beautiful, also served as food and
shelter for innumerable animals, and have
become so useful to us as coal, lignite, black-lead,
and other productions of ancient forests.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">We</span> must now go back and collect the
smaller pieces of “the puzzle” which make
up the animal part. The great periods of
vegetation ended in our country with the coal
forests, and there has been no such wonderful
growth of plants since the time when the
New Red Sandstone, lying above the coal,
was formed; though no doubt trees and plants
have since flourished, as they do now on the
Earth, but not in such quantities as during
the coal period.</p>

<p>We remember that the eozöon, “the life-dawn
animal,” is the oldest animal we know
of, and that it lived so long ago as when the
Laurentian rocks were laid down at the
bottom of the seas of that time; then in
later rocks we find the burrows of sea worms
in the stone, and later still simple shells
with two valves like the common mussel, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
other animals of a simple kind, like the corals,
sponges, and star-fishes which exist now.
There must have been millions of these
creatures in the older limestone seas, for the
rocks are almost entirely composed of their
fossil shells and bodies. By-and-by a rather
superior animal inhabited the seas of Wales,
called a trilobite, of which you will see a
picture on the opposite page. This curious
animal was of the same family as the shrimps
and prawns, but much larger, and he must
have been a giant among the others. None
of these animals had any bones, you must
understand; but they had a hard shelly
covering to support their soft bodies inside,
and no doubt the trilobites were able to swim
about very fast.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>Trilobite.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>What I want you to take notice of now is
the <em>progress</em> that has been going on from the
almost motionless eozöon to the shell-fish
and star-fish, which could crawl along the
bottom of the sea and over the rocks, to this
active, quick-moving trilobite, with his great
paddles. Then the next step is a very great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>one, when we come to animals with bones.
The first of these are fishes. All the other
bones are joined to the backbone, therefore
all animals with bones are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vertebrata</i>,
which is a Latin word meaning having a
backbone with joints. Now animals with
bones are plainly superior to those with only
shells, and when we find fishes among the
rocks of Wales and Devonshire we know
that we are beginning to pick up some
important pieces of the “puzzle of life.”
These fishes were most of them related to
the sturgeon, and their bones and teeth are
found in great quantities in the Old Red
Sandstone rocks, just below the coal.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>It is not until we get above the coal into
the oolite or egg-stone rocks that still larger
and altogether superior animals, both of sea
and land, began to increase, and this is called</p>


<h3>THE AGE OF REPTILES.</h3>

<p>This has been called the reptile age because
there were such numbers of animals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
like crocodiles, lizards, and tortoises (which
are all reptiles), and some of them were of
immense size. For instance, there was a huge
creature something like a frog, but as large
as a Shetland pony, called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Labyrinthodon</i>,
with a great many curious teeth, and this
animal has left footprints in the New Red
Sandstone which have been dried and buried,
we can’t tell how long, and there are the
cracks made by the sun drying the place he
walked over when that was soft earth.
There is a drawing of some of these footsteps
in the picture on the next page, and there
are also the footprints of a large bird, and
you can see where he walked over the soft
earth and made a long line of footmarks; and
if you look at the footprints of birds on the
snow or mud now you will notice marks just
like these. Then there is another picture of
a single footprint of a large bird, and all those
round dots are where rain-drops fell and left
their marks in the soft earth.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_p083" style="max-width: 43.5625em;">

<p class="center no-indent"><em>(3) Footprints of Birds, (2) with marks of Rain-drops</em>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>I dare say you will wonder how it is that
these footprints have not disappeared. Well,
when the animals and birds that made them
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>had gone the marks became filled with dry
sand, no doubt blown in by the wind, and
then the mud dried hard, and at last it became
covered with other earths and sank slowly
down, just as the coal forests had done before,
and remained there until we dug it up with
these tracks of the birds and animals that
lived then. Some of these birds must have
been larger than any living now, because their
footmarks are so long. None of their bones
have been found yet, I believe, but plenty of
the teeth and some bones of the labyrinthodon
have. The real footmarks, of course,
are very large, though they are small in the
picture.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the great beds of Lias there are many
other strange animals, and among them are
two great fish-lizards called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ichthyosaurus</i>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Plesiosaurus</i>. Both of these lived in the
water and perhaps came on land sometimes,
and it is certain that they must have been very
ferocious creatures, from their great size and
sharp teeth. The plesiosaurus would be able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
to raise his long neck above the water and
snap at some of those curious birds rather
like bats which lived at the time, and of
which I shall have something to say presently.
Some of these fish-lizards were as large as
whales, and their bodies have been so beautifully
preserved in the limestone rocks that we
can actually sometimes find in their stomachs
the food they lived on.</p>

<p class="center no-indent">FISH-REPTILES.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Now we have got to a higher order of
creation still, these fish-lizards, and they remind
one of the next step in progress—birds.
You know that all birds lay eggs, so do
almost all reptiles, such as crocodiles, lizards,
and most snakes, so that they are alike in
this. Then the plesiosaurus with his long
neck reminds us of such birds as the heron
and the swan, but he is altogether more like
a reptile than either a fish or a bird. There
were also huge land reptiles, which lived in
the forests of the time, and must have been a
terror to the smaller animals. From the bones
of one of these which have been found in the
oolite clays near Weymouth in Dorsetshire
(the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cetiosaurus</i>), we see that it must have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>been nearly as large as an elephant, and
there are others called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megalosaurus</i>,
<em>Dinosaurus</em>, &amp;c. All these names end with
<em>saurus</em>, a name taken from the Greek word
meaning lizard; and you will see now why the
oolite, or “Jurassic”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> age, as it is sometimes
called, is well named the “reptile age,” for
these creatures swarmed on the land and in
the sea. Specimens of these you can see for
yourselves in the cases on the walls of the
third room in the North Gallery of the British
Museum, where all the fossils are collected.</p>

<p>But still more extraordinary animals
than any of these lived at the time, and we
can scarcely tell whether they were birds or
reptiles, as they were something like both,
but I suppose we must call them flying reptiles,
and they are the nearest approach to
birds that had yet existed. These creatures
are called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pterodactyles</i>, from two Greek words
which mean “wing-fingered.” Suppose the
little fingers of both your hands were a yard
longer than the others, and suppose a thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
leathery skin was stretched from the tips of
your long little fingers to each of your feet,
you would have wings something like a
pterodactyl and also something like the
wings of a bat. But the pterodactyl had a
long neck and a long beak-like mouth, full
of long sharp pointed teeth. It could not
walk much I think, but it could hang itself
up by its hind limbs to a tree or rock, head
downwards like a bat, and must have been
able to fly very strongly, with its huge
leathery wings, but it had no feathers.
There were swarms of these curious half
lizard half bird-like animals on the land, and
they were of all sizes, some no bigger than
a crow, and some as large as the albatross,
measuring twelve feet across their outstretched
wings. Their skeletons are some
of the commonest fossils in the oolite rocks,
all through the great reptile age.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Now you see we have come to a reptile
that can fly, but, excepting for its wings and
some of its bones, more like a crocodile than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
a bird. A little further on we find another
curious animal in the oolite rocks, which is
much more like a true bird than the pterodactyl,
because it had feathered wings. It is
called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Archæopteryx</i>, which means “ancient
wing,” and I have given a picture of it
on the same page as the pterodactyl, so that
you may compare them together. The blade-bone
and “merry-thought” of this creature
were exactly like those of a bird, and so
were the feet and legs, which would enable
it to walk easily, or perch on the branch of
a tree, but the tail was long and many-jointed
like that of a lizard, with a fan of
feathers growing on each side of it, and
short feathered wings. Then it most likely
had teeth like a lizard, and there were short
claws at the bend of the wings. This bird-reptile
was about the size of a crow, and was
the first we know of with feathers, and the
limestone rock has preserved it most beautifully
through all the long ages which have
passed since it flitted over the land of the
oolite period.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Later still than these, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
lived in America, about the time the chalk was
formed in England, two strange birds called
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hesperornis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ichthyornis</i>, both of which
had teeth in the jaws. The former was an
immense fellow like the penguin, with short
wings, and the latter was about the size of a
pigeon with large feathered wings.</p>

<p>They are finding more of these curious
creatures every now and then in America.
Some are without teeth, and have a horny
bill like that of a real bird, and in other ways
more nearly resemble living birds; still they
have not lost the appearance of reptiles in
their principal bones.</p>

<br>

<p>I have been particular in describing some
of these fish-lizards and bird-reptiles; because
they, or their near relations, were the principal
inhabitants of land and sea from the end
of the coal period to the end of the chalk,
though there were of course swarms of fishes
and shell-fish; but I ought to tell you that
even so early as this there was at least one
animal known which suckled its young ones,
and this was a small insect-eating creature
not larger than a rat, of the same family
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>(called <em>Marsupial</em>) as the kangaroo of
Australia, which carries its young ones in
a pocket or pouch in its skin.</p>

<p>All this time we have been hunting for
parts of “the puzzle” in those ancient oolite
rocks between the coal and the chalk, and
those we have found are very important.
We have seen the slow progress from simple
sea shells to simple fishes, and then onwards
to fish-lizards and bird-reptiles with one
little marsupial animal, of a far higher kind,
in between, as if to tell us beforehand what
more complete and perfect animals we might
expect by-and-by. After the fishes we have
found fish-lizards, then bird-reptiles with
wings, but no feathers, and later still a bird-reptile
with wing and tail feathers. How
different the life of the Earth was at the end
of the “reptile age” of the oolite rocks, to
the far back Laurentian time when one
little creature, our old friend eozöon, alone
held possession of the seas!</p>


<h3>THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.</h3>

<p>Now let us look into the rocks next
above, and see what is to be found there.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
We have arrived in the Cretaceous period,
or time when the chalk was formed.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> You
remember I told you you might call this
“foraminifera earth” because so much of
it was made up of the shells of these tiny
animals, thousands of which could be put into
a thimble. Whenever you make a mark with
a piece of drawing chalk you rub off a number
of them, and you will see what pretty little
creatures they were if you look at the drawings
of some of them on the next page as they are
seen under the microscope, magnified thousands
of times their natural size; but there
are others of different shapes. On the same
page too there is a handsome shell, called an
ammonite, and of its real size, common in
chalk rocks. The seas of the time must have
been very deep as I have explained before,
and the chalk contains numbers of bones of
fishes everywhere, and many of the remains
of the reptile-like creatures of the time before.
Corals, sea-urchins, crabs, &amp;c., abounded, and
as you can scarcely ever see chalk without
immense flint stones in it, you may suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>what millions of sponges lived on the rocks,
for these flints are partly made up of their
fossil bodies.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Another Cretaceous period is
beginning now at the bottom of the Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans, where it is deep enough
to cover the Alps, for these little foraminifera
are living on the surface in countless millions,
and day by day their fossil shells are settling
down to the bottom and forming a soft grey
mud, full of the carbonate of lime like chalk.
The climate of the Cretaceous age was mild
and pleasant, as we know from the kind of
animals in the seas. Slowly the water began
to get shallower and shallower by the upheaval
of the bed, and at last the bottom of
this mighty chalk ocean came up to the light
and sun, to be covered in some places with the
drift and worn particles of older rocks swept
over it by rivers, and to receive new plants and
new animals, and in some places to remain
almost bare, as it is on the downs of Brighton.</p>

<br>

<p>Now we take one more step upwards into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
almost a new world—the world on which
mighty animals lived, and which man came
to share with them.</p>


<h3>THE TERTIARY PERIOD.</h3>

<p>The reign of the reptiles is now passed.
The ichthyosaurus and pterodactyl no longer
inhabited the seas and continents. Great
changes had taken place in the shape of the
land. A river larger than the Rhine swept
majestically through England from the borders
of Wales right out into the German
Ocean, and its banks were covered with forests
and marshes, where the new animals which
had come to take possession of the earth
lived and moved and had their being. The
mountains of the Pyrenees were raised above
the sea, and parts of Surrey and Sussex
appeared too. It was most likely in the
early part of the Tertiary period that the
stone was formed of which almost all Paris
is built. Fancy a great city built of the shells
of dead animals! One can scarcely believe it:
but the microscope lets us into this secret of
Nature. If we take a piece of this stone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
examine it in a powerful microscope we see
that it is made almost entirely of tiny shells,
so small that myriads of them could be
packed in a nut-shell. How long must they
have been working to make all the stone beds
of which Paris is built? We cannot measure
the time, we can only know it must have
been enormous!</p>

<p>All kinds of animals both of sea and land
increased in numbers and perfection. The
ammonites were dead, but their even more
beautiful relation, the nautilus, was living as
it is now. The trilobite was gone, but his
next relation, the lobster and crab, appeared.
Fishes abounded. Whales which suckle their
young ones appeared, and the numbers of vertebrata,
or animals with backbones, were more
numerous than they had ever been before.
Just as animals with bones are more perfect
than those with only skins or shells, so animals
which suckle their young ones are more perfect
than those which only lay eggs. Thus the
whale is a more perfect animal than the shark,
though both inhabit the water; and elephants
and even rats and mice more perfect still; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
because there were so many of these “sucklers,”
or mammalia as they are called, in the Tertiary
period, we know that all living creatures were
becoming more perfect. It will interest you
too to learn that monkeys began to appear
now, and that they were common in France,
while at the present time the only part of
Europe where they are to be found is on the
rock of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>But I want particularly to tell you of the
giant animals—the Mammoth, Mastodon,
Megatherium, Dinotherium, and others, and
first let us see what the mammoth was like.</p>

<p>In former times, when people accidentally
found the bones of these animals, they actually
thought they had belonged to giant <em>men</em>, and
we can scarcely wonder at that: but we know
better. If only one small bone is shown to
Professor Owen or Professor Huxley, he can
tell at once whether it belonged to a man or
an animal, a fish or a bird, and very often
the particular animal too. Well, the bones of
the mammoth were found in the north of
Russia on the banks of the river Lena in
1800: but the Russians knew of them before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
that, and the name they gave the animal
means “earth,” because they supposed it
burrowed in the earth like a mole. This one
is now in the Museum at St. Petersburg, and
its brownish coat and long black hairs, and
even the hoofs and some of the flesh, can be
distinctly seen. The drawing in the frontispiece
is taken from it. It was strange that
any people could have supposed that this
huge creature, larger than an elephant and
with great curved tusks ten feet long and
weighing 160 lbs., could have got underground
of its own accord: but that was the
only way in which they could account for
finding it buried in the earth on the banks of
the rivers. Look at the picture in the frontispiece;
what a splendid animal he was, this old
elephant; larger and stronger than any living
elephants! Immense quantities of their bones
are found in Siberia, and the tusks and teeth
are brought in ship-loads to England, where
they are sold for their ivory. Their skeletons
have been found in most countries of Europe,
in many parts of Asia, and in North America,
and these animals must have been common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
at one time near London, for their bones have
been dug up in the brick earth at Ilford in
Essex and other places near the Thames.
There is a skull with tusks set up with iron
supports in the British Museum.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>There was besides another animal very
much like this called the Mastodon; but it had
tusks in the lower jaws as well as the upper,
four in all, and the lower tusks dropped out
when the animal grew old. The whole
skeleton of one of these is also put up in the
Museum, which you ought to go and see.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Mastodons’ bones have been discovered in
England and other parts of Europe, and in
North and South America and India, so that
they were spread pretty well all over the world.
They had very curious pointed teeth rather
like a lot of fir cones piled together, not flat
grinders like those of the mammoth and all
living elephants, and perhaps they fed upon
fruits and nuts, and boughs, as I do not think
they could have managed well to chew grass
and leaves with such pointed teeth. The
teeth in their old dead jaws are still beautifully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
white and look like china. Both the
mammoth and the mastodon had long trunks
of course, and they must have been grand looking
creatures marching about in the English
forests. We should be very much startled if
we were to meet one of them now in an English
wood: but there is no chance of that,
they have all passed away, and the only
relations they have living are the elephants of
Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>During this Tertiary period, or at least
the early part of it, besides the mammoth and
mastodon, the hippopotamus and rhinoceros
were plentiful about the Thames. Those
same Ilford marshes in Essex have been a
complete storehouse of the remains of these
animals. The bones of a hundred different
mammoths and eighty rhinoceroses have been
dug up lately from the damp, black soil, as
well as many belonging to the hippopotamus,
and we can have no doubt that all the
swamps along the north side of the river
were inhabited by large herds of these huge
beasts, or so many of their skeletons could
not have been collected in one place. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
very likely they were overtaken in a flood of
the river and drowned, and their bodies sank
down in the mud of the river bank: but anyhow,
there they are to tell us that they
lived and died almost within sight of the
Tower of London, if it had been built then,
as of course it was not.</p>

<br>

<p>Long long ago too, before there was a
single brick where London stands, and when
the few human beings who were living were
obliged to hide themselves in caves, great
lions might have been heard roaring at night
in the forests of the Thames Valley. The
bones of this lion have been found in many
different parts of England, and a terrible
fellow he must have been, for some of his
canine teeth (the long sharp teeth in cats and
dogs) were more than six inches long. Indeed
they were like small swords, and this is why
he has been called the “sabre-toothed” lion.
There were also bears, like the great grisly
bear of America, and leopards, hyenas, and
wolves, and besides two kinds of ox far larger
than those we have now. But one of the
handsomest animals was the great Irish stag.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>When standing upright the top of his horns
would be as high as two tall men. He was
indeed a fine fellow with his immense spreading
antlers. The deer in our parks would
look dwarfs beside him. He inhabited both
England and Ireland: but, being found more
often in Ireland, he has got the name of the
<em>Irish</em> stag. As many as thirty of the
skeletons of these stags have been found together
under a bog in Ireland, and in some of
the bones the marrow is still preserved, and
they burn well. Fences have been made of
these bones in Ireland, and when the people
of a small village in the county of Antrim
heard of the battle of Waterloo they made a
great bonfire of the bones and horns of the
Irish stag to rejoice over the victory. I dare
say these stags were hunted by wolves, and
perhaps driven on to the ice of ancient lakes,
where they broke through and got drowned,
for so many of their skeletons are found together.
I could not pass this magnificent stag
by without giving you a picture of him.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
was a much nobler looking animal than the
reindeer, which lived along with him at the time
in England, and from his appearance I should
say he was a swift runner and great fighter.
Some antlers have been found locked together,
just as these stags died in mortal combat, and
I never see Sir Edwin Landseer’s beautiful
picture of two red-deer stags fighting without
thinking what a grand sight it would have been
to see two of these great Irish stags rushing
at each other with their powerful horns.</p>

<p>Not one of those animals is living now,
and none of them is mentioned in any history
or tradition whatever, and though there is no
doubt that men living in Europe saw the
mammoth alive (as you will find in the next
chapter), they knew of no kind of writing in
which to tell us of them; these fossils are
the only records left, but they speak plainly
enough of the time when England and the
whole of Europe were inhabited by these
races of huge animals.</p>

<p>Now I must carry you away to South
America, where there are more wonders. If
I were to tell you of all the singular monsters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>people have found in the beds of the rivers
there it would make a book of itself. You
know what large rivers there are in that
country, and how they run for thousands of
miles through almost flat plains called
“Pampas.” Well, these rivers have often
changed their beds by cutting new channels
in the soft soil. The old dry beds of the
rivers are the burying-places of some most
curious animals, but I have not room to tell
you about more than one of them at present.
He is called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Megatherium</i>, which means
“great beast.” His size and strength were
enormous. The largest hippopotamus looks
small by his side. His leg bones are bigger
than your body. He was more like the
sloth than any other living animal, but he
could not climb. He stood on those huge,
broad hind feet, with his strong tail as a sort
of third leg, and tore down the branches of
the trees to feed on, or even rooted them up
to get at the leaves. Standing by his skeleton
in the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> one feels quite a
shrimp, and he looks strong enough to walk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
away comfortably with an elephant on his
back.</p>

<p>Another immense animal inhabited South
America at the time, which geologists have
called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dinotherium</i>, or “dreadful beast.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> He
was a relation of the mastodon, but his tusks
were very curious. Instead of being in the
upper jaw and turned upwards they stuck out
from the lower jaw and curved downwards,
giving him a very odd appearance. He most
probably had a trunk like the mammoth or
mastodon, but perhaps not so long. All these
of course were vegetable feeders.</p>

<p>The Tertiary period is so remarkable for
the numbers of animals more or less related
to elephants and spread all over the world,
that we might almost call it the “elephant
age,” as the oolite has been named the “reptile
age.” These elephantine animals abounded
in Europe, Asia, and North and South
America, and though none of this kind have
yet been found in Australia and Africa, I
cannot help thinking they will be discovered
in Africa at all events, for there is no doubt
that Africa and Europe were once joined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>Australia you know possesses that animal
so unlike all others that when we first see it
we are quite astonished—the kangaroo. The
bones of a huge fossil kangaroo have been
found in Australia which must have stood
fourteen or fifteen feet high I should think
when on its hind legs, or more than twice as
large as any living now.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Then there were
giant birds in New Zealand (something like
the ostrich) called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dinornis</i> or “dreadful bird.”
These fellows had no wings, and they must
have been very much taller than the ostrich
or emu. To look at their leg bones you
would think they were the bones of oxen
instead of birds, they are so immensely thick
and strong. I do not think any of these are
living now, because they have been sought
for carefully, and none of the natives even
can say that they have seen one. But their
skeletons are common in the surface earth,
and their bones, cracked to get the marrow
out of them, are often dug out of the heaps
of refuse collected about ancient cooking
places. So that they were used for food, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
perhaps they have not been extinct—that is
to say, died out—more than a few hundred
years; and this is more likely because feathers
are sometimes attached to the remains, and
undecayed sinews on the feet. A human skeleton
has been found in a grave in New Zealand,
too, with the egg of one between its arms, and
little piles of pebbles are often seen among
their bones, where the stomach would be, which
the bird swallowed to digest its food, just as
many birds do now. The natives called it the
Moa, and they have some traditions about it,
and, all things considered, it is probably one
of the most recent fossil animals, and that is
the reason why I have left it to the last.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Now I dare say you will wish to know
when the animals living now took the place
of those I have described, and which have all
passed away. This cannot be told with certainty,
but you will see in the “Human Part”
that Men were living when the mammoth,
mastodon, and some other extinct animals, inhabited
the Earth, and that the reindeer, ox,
bear, wolf, hyena, &amp;c., have survived to the
present day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>Throughout these immense periods of
time there are gaps which we cannot yet
fill up. No one can yet say, for instance,
when the last of the mammoths disappeared,
and the first of their near relations, the Indian
and African elephants, took their place.
These are the missing parts of “the puzzle
of life” which you may perhaps one of these
days find when you come to study the subject,
and when you have learned all that is known
at present. But you may be sure of this, that
throughout all time there has been <em>progress</em>,
the lower forms of animal life have been followed
by more perfect forms as the Earth
grew older. It is true the lower forms of
life have not all died out. These imperfect
animals have run through all the ages—the
chalk builder of the Cretaceous age lives in
the ocean now—and there are many other
simple animals which lived in Old Red Sandstone
times, and are not extinct yet, but
wherever a superior kind of animal has passed
away another more perfect has taken its place.
This will be seen at once if we compare the
“Reptile Age” with the Tertiary. The great
ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, and pterodactyl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
are gone, but now we have the more perfect
crocodiles and birds. The mammoth is gone,
but we have the elephant. There are no
giant mosses or towering tree ferns, but our
forest trees are more perfect and more varied.
The plants which formed the coal forests and
once clothed the Earth with beauty have
dwindled away to the lowly forms which we
must stoop to examine in swamps, and these
humble plants are all the surviving relatives
of their once noble family. The lordly oaks
and elms, stronger, and even more lovely in
the sweet drapery of their foliage, and much
better fitted for our use, have succeeded all
those soft-stemmed plants which grew so fast
and were the best possible kind for forming
coal.</p>

<p>When you are able to study what is called
comparative anatomy you will see how wonderful
the <em>plan</em> of creation is, and how beautifully
it has been worked out by its great Designer.
You will see in the bones of the reptiles of the
oolite rocks a prophecy as it were of the birds
and animals which were to come. What
could be more prophetic of animals with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
power of perfect flight than the leather-winged
pterodactyl, half lizard and half bird? In
some of these animals you will see bones only
half formed, and useless to that creature, which
were brought to perfection in later times, and
became the most important part of the body.</p>

<p>It is very difficult for me to make all this
plain to you, but if you are really interested
in it you will go to a museum where the fossils
are collected, and then I am very much mistaken
if you do not find a new and strange
world opened to you.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_HUMAN_PART"><em>THE HUMAN PART.</em></h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the human race is of course
even more interesting than that of the plants
and animals which lived so long before man
and prepared the way for him, because man
is the “crown of creation.”</p>

<p>When first placed on this Earth he must
have been but little superior to the animals in
his outward life, though he had very different
powers within him. He could gather the
fruits of the Earth like them, and perhaps
used some of the smaller creatures as food,
but he could do little more. He scarcely
knew that he possessed the faculties which
would in time make him lord of the Earth
and the creatures inhabiting it. By slow
and painful experience he was to gather
those stores of knowledge that were to enable
him to overcome difficulties, to provide him
with shelter from the weather and protection
from dangerous animals, give increasing comfort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and power, and set him so far above all
other created things. He found plants and
animals for his use, and the dwellings in caves
and holes ready made by Nature. He could
neither build houses nor make weapons.
The first weapon he ever used probably was
a stone, which he could throw at small animals.
Then he would find out that long, sharp-pointed
sticks could be thrown like spears,
and he also found that a long pliant piece of
wood when bent would fly back, and in this
he would see a means of throwing smaller
pointed sticks like arrows, and I dare say the
discovery of the way of making a bow with
a string of twisted animal skin was a great
invention, and it certainly would be a very
valuable one. Many generations must have
passed away before he got even as far as this.
It is very easy for us, who see bows and arrows
from our childhood, to understand their use at
once: but the first human inhabitants of the
world had to find them out for themselves.
They began with <em>no</em> knowledge at all. The
beasts of the field and the fruits of the Earth
were given them, but they could <span class="allsmcap">MAKE</span> nothing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
They had not even the natural covering of
hair, or wool, or feathers, which animals and
birds have, and they must first have clothed
themselves with skins of these. The wants
of their daily life were so great that they had
no time to think of anything else, but when
it became easier to satisfy these bodily wants
their minds turned to other things. They must
have seen that when the seeds and fruits of
plants fall upon the ground they grow and produce
the same kind of plant, but they did not
at first think of gathering a great number of
these seeds and sowing them in one place and
making a garden. They could wander about
and gather all they needed as they became
ripe, for there were few people then. Their
life was like that of the lilies of the field, they
“toiled not neither did they spin,” as Christ
says of the flowers, but when they began to
increase in number something more was
wanted. People began to feel something
within them which we call “intellect,” and
this must be satisfied. It was not enough to
live as if they were no nobler than the animals.
Something stirred in their minds which told
them they must not stand still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>The Creator has made both us and the
wood and stone and metals, and has given
to us the power to make other things out of
them. Thus we are nearer to Him in power
than any of the animals who cannot change the
rough materials into other forms. We admire
the simple and really beautiful nest of the
bird, but we feel that our power is greater
when we consider our splendid buildings and
steam-engines, our ships, and our many conquests
over difficulties. But if we did not
use these greater powers of mind and hand
well, we should find them grow weaker and
weaker until we might almost lose them.</p>

<p>You may easily suppose that there was a
time when men could not write, and there
were no books of any kind, nor any other
means of exchanging thoughts except through
spoken language. The earliest histories
about the human race always speak of men
who lived before those histories were written.
We have nothing about the earliest men
written by <em>themselves</em>. It is always someone
else who writes of them, referring to their
deeds, and to events which happened long
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The art of writing has grown up gradually
and very slowly, for when the inhabitants
of the Earth became numerous they felt the
need of some way of expressing themselves to
those at a distance from them, and for making
a record of things that happened and might
be forgotten. Some of the earliest means
of writing were by pictures, like the picture
writings of Mexico<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> found by the Spanish
conquerors, and something of the same kind
is even now used by the Chinese and
Japanese. Their writing is made up partly
of pictures and partly of queer signs which
stand for the names of things, as you know if
you have ever seen one of their books. One
of the oldest forms of writing known is the
hieroglyphic, which is said to have been first
used by the Egyptians about 2,100 years
before Christ, and another is the arrow-shaped
writing of the Assyrians. These were cut on
stone and metal tablets, and most of them are
the histories of their kings. But there are
some writings on stone in India which are
thought to be older still. The Egyptians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
made great progress in writing afterwards
when <em>papyrus</em> was invented.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This is a kind
of paper made from a reed which grows
abundantly in the river Nile, and many of
these papyrus writings are preserved in the
British Museum, as well as the writings on
stone of the Egyptians and Assyrians, and
learned men have spelled out a great deal of
the history of these nations from them, though
the language is quite different from any
spoken or written now.</p>

<p>Picture writing was most likely one of
the earliest inventions in this way: but it
was so troublesome that signs were used to
express the same things as the picture. For
instance, suppose a history of a king was to be
written. The word “king” would be shown
by something he always wore, such as his
crown, and this sign would become more
simple until at last it might not be anything
like a crown; but it would be remembered
that the sign stood for a king all the same.
The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, <em>aleph</em>,
means an ox, and the letter is something like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the shape of the head of that animal with
its horns; and another letter, called <em>shin</em>,
which in Hebrew means a tooth, is actually
very like a tooth with three points. In many
languages these signs have become so altered
that they do not now resemble the things
they at first stood for; but the first steps in the
invention of written language were certainly
made by signs representing the thing of
which the person wished to give an idea.
But you will learn all about these ancient
writings from other books.</p>

<p>The men whose lives I am going to
describe lived long before any of these writings
were invented. They <em>spoke</em> a language
of course, though there is nothing left to show
that they knew of any kind of writing, and they
are called Pre-historic men because they lived
before there were any histories either written
by themselves or about them. But they
could draw a little, as we know from the
pictures of animals, birds, and fishes scratched
upon pieces of slate, and bone, and stone found
in their graves. Perhaps these pictures were
memorials of their great or wise men, or showed
that they were clever hunters, or fishermen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>They knew the use of fire. Half burnt
bones and wood and ashes are plentiful in the
caves where they lived. They had none of
the means we possess for kindling fire, and
there are only two ways by which they could
have got it. They might have rubbed two
pieces of very dry wood together until the
heat lighted them, as many savages do at
the present time; or they might have struck
sparks from flint upon rotten wood and blown
the spark into a flame. We may be sure that
when once a fire was lighted they would take
care it did not go out, and if they wanted to
travel they would carry with them a piece of
smouldering wood to light the fire again. I
do not suppose that these pre-historic men
were any more civilized than the savages of
Australia and other countries, and I have often
thought when looking at these savages that
they live in almost exactly the same way as
the earliest inhabitants of Europe did. They
have the same shaped weapons and tools
made of stone, and these are fixed to the
handles in the same way. They have the
same kinds of needles and fish-hooks made
of bone, and they sew skins together with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
threads made from the sinews of animals.
Thus we see men living now in many parts
of the world who are quite as uncivilized as
the old inhabitants of Europe, who lived
perhaps thousands of years before the Egyptians
and Assyrians.</p>

<p>These very ancient men knew nothing
about metals. All their tools were made of
flint, or bone, or stone, and they were of the
rough shape you see in the pictures on the
next page, and it is for this reason that this
has been called the <em>Stone Age</em>. These were
chipped out with great trouble and labour,
and most of them were not even polished.
With these they had to kill animals for food,
to cut down trees, and fight against their
enemies. The skeleton of a mastodon was
found in the state of Missouri in America
about thirty-five years ago with numbers of
these flint arrow-heads underneath and near
it. Perhaps it had been shot at with arrows,
and when it died the flint points fell out of its
decaying flesh. But it is not likely that these
pre-historic men could have killed many such
large animals, unless they caught them in pits
covered over with branches of trees and earth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>into which they might fall, as elephants are
sometimes caught in Africa.</p>

<p>Nothing shows us so well the immense
time which must have passed since the men
of the stone age lived as that these flint
weapons and tools are found nearly all over
the world, in Northern Europe, including our
own country, in Spain, France, Italy, Greece,
Palestine, Africa, Japan, America, &amp;c.; and
yet none of the present inhabitants of these
countries have any history or tradition of the
time when they were used. Metals are now
used instead, and there is no record of the
time when flint only was known. We are
quite certain however that the stone age men
lived at the same period as the great animals
of the Tertiary age, the mammoth, the mastodon,
the woolly rhinoceros, the Irish stag,
the cave bear, and others you have read of
in former chapters, because flint and stone
weapons are found in the same beds of earth
with these animals.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Suppose one of the present Indian or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
African elephants with his rider were to fall
into a river and they were to sink to the
bottom and be covered with mud, and suppose
his rider had in his pocket some of our sovereigns.
If that elephant should be accidentally
dug up thousands of years to come, when most
likely all elephants will have died off the earth,
people would know for certain, from the date
and figure of the Queen on the money, that
elephants were used by the English in this
reign, even if all our books and monuments
had perished, and a new people inhabited the
Earth. Something of the same kind has happened
to prove to us that the stone-age men
saw the mammoth alive. In one of their
graves there is a slice of a mammoth’s great
back tooth with a beautiful picture of the
animal, with his bristly hair, scratched on the
ivory, and there are also many of the flint
and stone weapons which show that the
skeleton in the grave was that of a primeval
man. This little picture tells its tale
more faithfully than any history. It is all
the more certain to tell it truly because it was
never <em>meant</em> to tell one. When that man
was buried with this sign that he was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
mighty hunter of the mammoth, or an artist,
no one could imagine that he would ever be
dug up to show us, who come so long afterwards,
that he saw the mammoth roaming
through the forests of the far away past.
There can be no doubt that it is a very good
drawing of the mammoth with its long turned-up
tusks, like those in the picture at the
beginning of the book.</p>

<p>In another place a picture of a fight
between some reindeer scratched upon a
piece of slate has been found. This was in a
cave in France, and it, as well as the numbers
of bones of these animals in the caves, shows
that the reindeer, which now only inhabits the
Arctic regions, must have been common then
in France. You will see drawings of both
these on page <a href="#i_p135-1">135</a>.</p>

<p>These primeval people built no houses.
They lived in natural caves, and scattered the
remains of their food about the floor, so that
we know what they ate. Among the animals
they used for food were the horse, the reindeer,
the ox, the cave-lion and bear, the wolf, the
hyena, the goat, the hare and several others,
besides salmon and other fish. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
very fond of the marrow of the bones, which
they cracked with stone hammers, and had
little spoons made of bone with which to pick
it out.</p>

<p>They had places for making flint weapons
too. At Cissbury Camp, near Worthing,
there is one of their old workshops. There
are galleries dug into the chalk where they
got the flints, and there are thousands of chips
of flint lying about, with half finished arrow-heads,
and some of the tools they dug with.
They had no spades or pickaxes; but they
used the broad, flat, shoulder-blade bone of
the ox as a spade, and the sharp brow antler
of a deer’s horn for a pickaxe, to get these
flints out with. It must have been very hard
work for them, because bone spades and horn
pickaxes would soon wear out, and would not
be nearly so useful as ours made of iron.</p>

<p>It is difficult to be certain how these stone-age
people cooked their food. Of course
they could have roasted it, and the half-burnt
bones in some caves show that they
did so; but in some caves in France there is
not a single burnt bone to be found. In
these French cave dwellings, too, there are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>no pieces of earthenware, as there are in
some others; so that the people could not
have boiled it, unless they had wooden
pots and dropped red-hot stones into the
water in them until the meat got boiled, as
some savages do now. Or they might have
cooked it under the hot ashes.</p>

<p>The people who used earthenware must
have made more progress. It is easy to
understand how they made this useful discovery.
Suppose they had lighted a fire
upon a damp clay soil, the earth would get
baked hard and crack off in pieces, and they
would see that this soil could be worked in
the hands while soft into the shape of pans
and dishes, which could be dried quite hard
in the sun or baked in hot ashes, just as
boys make clay marbles now. They could
live much more comfortably even with these
rough earthenware things, and cook their
food more conveniently; but they still used
the stone and flint tools and weapons, and
iron was still unknown to them.</p>

<p>The people of whom I have been speaking
are principally the men of the First Stone
Age, when the art of polishing tools and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
weapons had not been found out. They
simply chipped these things out of the flints
and left them very rough; but the men of the
next, or Second Stone Age, made great improvements.
They ground their flint knives
and axes with other stones, and rubbed them
down to sharp edges and points, so that they
must have been much more useful for killing
and cutting up the animals they hunted. All
their bone and horn tools are much better
made, and sometimes ornamented prettily
with marks cut upon them. The Second
Stone Age men evidently wore clothing,
most probably made of the skins of animals—for
the long strips of bone with a hole
at one end which you see in the picture
could not have been used for any other
purpose, except to draw threads through
something. The threads were very likely
either the sinews of animals pulled out of the
flesh, or thin strips of their skins, or perhaps
the inner bark of a tree twisted into a kind
of string. In the colder parts of Europe
and America these ancient people would
need some protection from the weather.
How then did the people of the First Stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
Age manage, if they had no bone needles,
as I think they had not, with which to make
clothing? They must have wrapped themselves
in the skins just as they came from
the backs of the animals.</p>

<p>It is not easy to be always sure, when we
find a cave and all these relics of pre-historic
man, whether the inhabitants belonged to the
First or the Second Stone Age. Sometimes
there are signs of polishing and grinding on
the tools, and then we may suppose that men
were gradually getting more skilful, until they
finished off all their weapons beautifully.
But there is such a very great difference in
the perfection of these useful articles found
in some places and those found in others
that we have no doubt men made slow progress,
from the rough or First Stone Age,
to the polished or Second Stone Age.</p>

<p>In neither the first nor second stone period
had men yet learned to build any kind of
habitations. They lived in caves simply, like
wild animals. On the banks of the river
Vezère in France, which has cut its way
deeply through the rock, there are some
celebrated caves once inhabited by pre-historic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
men, and some of them are very large.
They were most likely hollowed out in the
cliff by water, and many generations of men
lived here. In one of them four human
skeletons were found, with plenty of stone and
flint tools, besides the bones of the mammoth
and lion, reindeer and other animals. The
mammoth then as well as the reindeer lived
at that time in the valley of the Vezère.
There is no doubt that these caves were inhabited
at separate times by people who used
only the roughest and simplest stone tools,
and by others who had made some progress
and could polish their tools and make them of
bone and could scratch pictures of animals
upon slips of bone and slate. It is curious that
all these drawings are side-view drawings, and
they are only outlines, just like the drawings
of children now, and the Esquimaux of the
Arctic regions; because these people, although
they were grown up, had not discovered the
art of drawing in perspective and shading
the figures. Still the pictures are wonderfully
true to nature, and must have been copied
from living animals. There is no earthenware
in any of these caves, so that the useful art of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
making pottery had not been discovered,
neither is there any in the caves in Switzerland,
where the bones of the mammoth, lion,
and rhinoceros are also found, and the tools
and weapons are much the same as those in
the French caverns. It is impossible to say
whether the cave-dwellers of France and
Switzerland lived at the same time exactly,
but they were in about the same condition of
civilization, and they must both have been
quite familiar with the appearance of the
mammoth and lion, and other animals, which
are not mentioned in any history, however
old it may be, as inhabitants of these
countries.</p>

<p>A discovery has lately been made in
France of a large cavern near Belfort, in the
limestone rock, which has been covered up
for ages. The quarrymen while cutting out
the stone came upon a small opening leading
into a very large cave, in which there was
a great quantity of human skeletons and
bones and some beautifully ornamented vases,
polished stone bracelets, and a mat of plaited
rushes. To these people, then, the arts of
pottery and weaving were known, and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
was probably one of their burying-places.
They were evidently much more civilized
than the ancient people of the valley of the
Vezère; but this cave must also be of a
great age, and its inhabitants have left no
record of their history in any kind of
writing.</p>

<p>Quite lately, too, we have learned something
of the early races of man in Colorado.
Many of the caves in that country have been
altered and made more like regular houses,
and some appear even to have been cut
out of the rock entirely by human hands;
and in the plains there are ruins of large
cities.</p>

<p>Though still in the stone age, for all the
weapons yet found among these ruins are
of stone, the Colorado people were more
civilized than the stone-age people of the
Vezère caverns, because they had begun to
build and knew how to make pottery. It is
strange, too, that the present natives of Colorado
are not so civilized as the early people,
and if they have descended from them they
have not improved, but rather the contrary.
There are other caverns in various parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the world containing these curious relics of
races long since passed away, but some of
the principal have been mentioned, enough
perhaps to interest you and show you that
men were living in Europe together with the
large animals of the Tertiary period, and that
they had made very little progress in the arts
and manufactures, and had not even begun to
build the roughest houses.</p>

<p>In many parts of the world even now
there are savages nearly as uncivilized as the
cave-dwellers of Europe were then. When
Captain Cook visited New Zealand, more
than a hundred years ago, the natives there
had nothing but stone and bone tools, very like
those found in the European caverns, and the
inhabitants of some of the islands in the Pacific
Ocean still use stone axes and hammers
and bone needles.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Captain Moresby, too,
who made a voyage to the south-east coast
of New Guinea a few years ago, tells us
that the natives have beautiful stone axes,
but they were so ignorant of the use of iron
that they refused to give him one of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
stone axes for a new iron hatchet which he
offered them. No doubt the stone weapon
cost a great deal of labour and patience to
make, and perhaps the iron one was made by
machinery in a few minutes, and was really
more useful, but the native had proved his
own axe and knew nothing of the iron one,
so that it is no wonder that he refused it.
But what a history these two axes tell—the
stone and the iron! The stone shows us
man in his childhood, and the iron man in his
manhood, and what an immensely long time
there is between the two. How much
thought, and trial and failure, and patience
and industry, were spent by mankind before
the stone axe grew into the iron!</p>

<p>In Europe man has long since grown out
of his childhood, but in many parts of the
world he is no more civilized than the men
who saw the mammoth crashing through the
forests of England and France, and heard
the lion roar at night on the banks of
the Thames, and watched the hippopotamus
swimming across the river at Westminster.
It is most likely, then, that Europe and parts
of Asia and America were inhabited long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
before those places where men are even now
in the stone age—such as the islands in the
Pacific Ocean, New Guinea, Australia, &amp;c.</p>

<p>What a life the pre-historic men of Europe
must have lived! Here they were surrounded
by huge dangerous animals, and had no
means of protecting themselves against them
but with these rough stone weapons. Where
London now stands with its miles of streets
and busy life there was a mighty forest, and
the mammoth and rhinoceros tramped through
it by day, and the lion and hyena hunted
the deer at night. When the pre-historic men
came down to the banks of the Thames in
the day-time to spear salmon, they saw the
hippopotamus plunging about in the water
among the rushes, sweeping the long grass
into their wide mouths, and swimming from
side to side with their young ones perched
upon their necks. It must have been a
grand sight, but a fearful one too, and it is
no wonder that men thought the caves the
only safe places to live in.</p>

<p>Sometimes in India the elephants come
into the villages at night and throw down
wooden houses and kill people, and they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
very much feared, so that we can suppose
how much more terrible the mammoth might
have been to the uncivilized cave-dwellers.
If they shot at him with the flint-pointed
arrows they could scarcely hurt him, and it
is more likely that they got out of his way as
quickly as possible whenever they met him,
and took good care never to interfere with
the lion and rhinoceros.</p>


<h3>THE LAKE-DWELLERS.</h3>

<p>Among the earliest inhabitants of Europe,
there were some who did not live in caves;
but I think they must have lived a long time
after the cave-dwellers, when they built their
houses out in the middle of the lakes.
These houses were built in a very curious
way, and the remains of them have been discovered
in Ireland and Scotland, Switzerland
and other countries. The people carried
quantities of stones, and earth, and sticks out
into the lake and let them sink to the bottom.
Then when they had piled up enough to make
an island, they laid wood across and set up
their huts, and lived there surrounded by water.
These were very poor houses of course; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>when men had begun to build for themselves,
they would find how much more comfortable
they were than in damp and dark caves.
They must have had some kind of boats or
canoes, or they could not have passed between
their lake-dwellings and the land unless they
swam to them; but I do not think that any of
these boats have been found. Perhaps they
were made of the dried skins of animals
stretched over wooden frames, as I have seen
savages make boats.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p148" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p148.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">XII.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>Lake-Dwellings.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>There was another way of building these
lake-dwellings, and a better way too. Long
poles were driven into the earth at the bottom
of the water, and when the builders had got
enough of these together they laid other
poles across them, and built their huts on
this floor above the water. People are living
now in much the same way near the Orinoco
river in South America, in New Guinea, and in
Central Africa.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The land all round is covered
with water from the overflowing of the rivers,
which are very large, and the huts are built up
on these poles out of the way of it. The lake-dwellers
of Europe would thus be safer in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
houses from dangerous animals than if they
were on land. They were more civilized than
the cave-dwellers, but still a great many of their
tools and weapons were of stone and bone;
yet we know that they had made wonderful
progress, because they had learned to make
pottery, and even to weave cloths out of hemp
or flax. They had most likely begun to plant
and cultivate the land, too, for corn is found
about these dwellings, and the bones of
domestic animals are very numerous. They
had left the cave-dwellers a long way behind
in many things, in wearing artificial clothing,
in cultivating the land, and in keeping domestic
animals; but their implements—that
is, their weapons and tools—were not much
improved, and were very much like those of
the cave-dwellers, though better finished and
more polished than some of theirs.</p>

<p>But not all the articles used by the lake
people were of stone and bone. Some of those
who lived in the Swiss lakes had ornaments,
such as bracelets and hair-pins, made of the
metal called bronze, and no doubt they made
spear-heads of the metal, because they would
look to usefulness before ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Now you see how these people seem to
have lived: first the old stone age men, then
those of the newer or polished stone age, and
lastly the lake-dwellers. The people of both
the first and second stone ages certainly saw
the mammoth, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, lion,
and reindeer alive in France, Switzerland, and
England; but when the lake-dwellings were
built, all these animals, except perhaps the
reindeer, had died, and most of the animals
were the same as they are now. None of these
people have left us any kind of history whatever,
except that which their simple works tell
us, their flint and bone weapons, and their
dwellings. They have set up no gigantic
monuments like the Egyptians or the Druids.
They thought of no men to come after them
who would take an interest in their ways; but
it is fortunate that what they did make was
of such lasting materials as stone and flint, or
we should have known next to nothing about
their lives.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say how many thousands
of years may have passed before the
rough stone weapons were replaced by the
polished stone, or the cave was exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
for an artificial house in a lake; but you must
feel in your minds that the time was immense,
and the more we study the ways and works
of pre-historic man, the more certain we
become that it is longer than the whole time
that has passed since men first began to use
any kind of writing.</p>


<h3>KITCHEN-MIDDENS.</h3>

<p>I dare say you have seen untidy people
in country places, and even in towns, throw
oyster-shells and broken dishes and dirt outside
their doors until quite a heap is formed.
This is called a “midden,” and the habit of
doing this is a very old one. We learn just
a little more of the history of man from great
middens made by ancient people in several
countries. They were first discovered in
Denmark, and since then they have been
found in Scotland, Brazil, and New Zealand.
They are sometimes very large, and must
have been used by the whole village as places
to throw the refuse of their cookery in. When
these heaps have been dug into all sorts of
things have been found in them—the shells of
oysters and mussels, bones of fishes, birds, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
animals, pieces of broken earthenware, little
ornaments, stone axes, arrow-heads, wood
ashes, burnt bones, and other odds and ends.
In Brazil many of these kitchen-middens are
on the sea shore, and it seems as if the people
who made them came there to live on the
shell-fish, for the shells are the same as those
living in the sea close by now. In New
Zealand the middens contain many of the
bones of the Moa, which was described in
“The Animal Part,” and has now perished, and
these are cracked in such a manner that the
people evidently wanted to get at the marrow
in them, and it shows too that this gigantic
bird was common in New Zealand then.
The midden makers seemed to have lived in
the open air, and wherever food was most
plentiful. Perhaps they built huts of the
bark and small branches of trees like the
Australian savages, but such houses would
not last. We only know of the life of the
midden makers from these heaps. Their
weapons are of the same kind and pattern as
those of the Second Stone Age, but they had
learned to make rough earthenware dishes
and basins, and some pieces of a woven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
material have been found, and pieces of wood
and bone worked with a little skill. Whether
they lived after or before the lake-dwellers I
cannot say, but I should think about the
same time.</p>

<p>These pre-historic people, nevertheless,
were not always thinking of making things
which were useful. They thought too of
making ornaments, many of which are found
in their dwellings and graves. Like ourselves,
they had an idea that little trinkets improved
their appearance. In one grave a skeleton
was found with a small pile of shells under
its neck, which no doubt had been strung
together as a necklace, and when the string
rotted the shells parted and fell in a heap under
the head, to be a memorial of that ancient man
or woman’s possession of the same feelings as
our own. Various little articles, too, found
about the lake-dwellings show that people
liked to decorate themselves.</p>

<p>We shall never know what language they
spoke, but they must have been able to tell
their thoughts to one another. It was most
likely a simple language with few words as
names for things and a simple grammar, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
the language of savages, because they had
not so many things to talk about as we have.
The names of animals would perhaps be
imitated from their cries and the noises they
made. These cries would be among the most
familiar sounds to them, and when they
wished to speak of some animal the simplest
way would be to imitate the noise it generally
makes. If we think of our own language, we
shall see how very likely this was. We have
many such words. We teach our children the
names of animals by the sounds they make.
The dog we call “bow-wow,” the cow “moo-moo,”
the duck “quack-quack,” and many
other names of the same kind which you will
think of yourselves. At the present time
even the name by which the Egyptians call
the donkey has almost exactly the same
sound as our “hee-haw.” This trick of
doubling or repeating the sound, too, is very
common among savages, who are as far behind
us as the pre-historic men were. The
natives of Australia give these double names
to a great many animals and things, and
sometimes do the same with English words.
They call fish “ningy-ningy,” and a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
tree the “bunya-bunya,” and their language
is full of such words. But it is not only the
names of things which have been made in
this way. Verbs as well as nouns have grown
up thus. When we whisper to one another,
that word imitates the low sound we make.</p>

<p>I shall leave you to trace the natural origin
of the following words, and think how much of
man’s spoken language is taken from common
sounds. Thus we have roar, shriek, whistle,
hiss, sigh, sing, ring, thump, bump, clash,
clang, bang, twang, clap, smack, slap, smash,
swish, swirl, gong, thong, boom, bellow,
batter, chatter, clatter, snap, snip, whip,
gurgle, shiver, quiver, rumble, roll, rattle,
prattle, and a hundred more. Words thus
derived from familiar sounds abound in all
languages, and they, no doubt, are the easy
steps by which men climbed to a more complicated
speech. The earliest men must
have been obliged to pay great attention to
animals and birds, which have voices of their
own; for to hunt and catch them was the
principal occupation of their lives; therefore,
when speaking of them to one another, they
would naturally call them by names resembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the sounds they made. Our verbs
“to squeak” and “to squeal” are certainly
taken from the cries of animals when in pain;
but I have said enough to show you how
language grew up among pre-historic people.</p>

<p>We do not know for certain that they had
any musical instruments, but they would hear
the sighing of the wind among the trees, and
it would almost certainly be found out that
blowing down a hollow stick or reed, open at
one end and closed at the other, would make
a whistle; but if they used any of these
things they would not last like the stone tools,
and have decayed away; and we do know
that they had begun to draw upon such imperishable
materials as bone and slate.</p>

<p>There is a very interesting specimen of a
human fossil in the British Museum, which
you ought to go and see, if you can; but in
case you are not able there is a drawing of it
on page <a href="#i_p159">159</a>.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This specimen was brought
to England about the year 1814. Others
like it have since been found imbedded in the
hard breccia limestone rock at the same place
on the shore of the island of Guadaloupe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
The skeleton most likely was that of a
woman, from the shape of some of the bones,
and most probably was of the race of Caribs,
of whom there are none living now. Perhaps
this was originally a burying place of the
ancient inhabitants of the island, and when
the sea washed the small broken pieces of
shells and corals over it (all of which contain
lime) they hardened into breccia rock, and
the skeleton became completely imbedded in
it. This must have taken a very long time,
at all events; but I do not think the Guadaloupe
fossils are as old as the people who
lived in the caves in France. Some little
ornaments and articles of human workmanship
are found with these skeletons, which
show that the people to whom they belonged
were still in the Stone Age. There is very
little to judge from when we wish to get some
idea of the time these fossils have been in
this breccia: but at this particular place
the rock is formed pretty quickly, as we can
see; and it is quite likely that these skeletons
were buried there long after the mammoth,
rhinoceros, and hippopotamus died out of
Europe. However, they are the most complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>specimens we have of any fossil human
beings. In looking at the drawing you will
see the leg bones and hips, part of the backbone,
the ribs of one side, and an arm bone;
but you see no skull, because the bones of
the skull are very thin, and have become
crushed down into the limestone. In one of
these fossils, which they have in Paris, taken
from near the same place, the bones are
much more distinct, and part of the lower
jaw with some teeth in it can be seen. These
fossil men no doubt lived before the period
of written human history began; but they
are not considered to be at all the oldest of
pre-historic men.</p>

<br>

<p>Two periods in the life of mankind followed
all these long-lost and forgotten people,
and they are called the Bronze Age and the
Iron Age; but now <em>history</em> comes in, and
there are plenty of old records and books to
tell you about these. Bronze is a mixed
metal of copper and tin, and it was used by
the oldest nations who have left any histories—the
Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans.
It was better than stone because it
could be made sharper and would not chip,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
and swords and armour, vases, axes, hammers,
needles, &amp;c., were made of it.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Stone Age is beyond all history, the
Bronze begins with it, and the Iron Age
began at some distant time before the dawn of
authentic history. Thus we are told, in Genesis
iv. 22, that Tubal Cain taught people to make
it. It was used also by the Egyptians for perhaps
2,000 years before the Christian era;
but the real Iron Age is that in which we are
living now. We can, indeed, make all metals
much better than any of the older nations.</p>

<p>But there is a wide gap between the time
when people left off using stone and discovered
bronze and iron; and if one of the
Druids could come to life he might help us to
fill it up, because those old British priests had
many secrets, which they told to one another
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>If the Spanish conquerors had not destroyed
the civilization of Mexico and Peru, we
might know something of the discovery of
the metals there, and the people of India and
China must have used them long ago; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
the first use of metal in any country where it
was found out would most likely be before
the people had begun to put their language
into any kind of writing, so that the time would
be forgotten among the many scraps of lost
knowledge which we have tried to collect from
the remains of the industry of pre-historic man.</p>

<p>We have seen how much these ancient
people differed from us in their civilization,
and how far they were behind us in everything;
but we must not suppose that they
were very different in bodily size and shape.
Some of their skulls might have belonged to
a philosopher, or they might have contained
the thoughtless brains of a savage. The
skulls from the Cromagnon and Engis caves
are quite equal in size and shape to those of
several uncivilized, and even of some civilized
races of the present time, and there are
people in all large cities whose heads are not
better formed. Though the outward signs of
their civilization then were so different from
ours, it is not certain that their mental
capacity was much less.</p>

<p>A race possessing considerable civilization
may, we know, pass away, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Assyrians and the Pyramid builders have.
In one of the Pacific islands—Easter Island—a
thousand miles from the nearest land,
there are hundreds of carved images of
stone, fifty or sixty feet high, and weighing
perhaps a hundred tons each. The people
who made these must have been very
numerous and must have had considerable
skill. Yet they have passed away. The arts
of Nineveh and Babylon have only lately
become known, so that, you see, the works of
a race may easily become hidden from us
who follow. Quite lately, too, the works of a
partly civilized people have been discovered
in Ohio in America. There are there
hundreds of mounds and earth embankments
forming fortified camps. Some of
them are several miles round, and they could
only have been made by a very numerous
and intelligent people who knew something
about geometry; for the circles, squares, and
angles of these earthworks are quite as
correct as we could make them. Among the
multitude of things found here are copper
tools made by hammering, ornamental
pottery, silver beads, plates of mica with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
scrolls and designs engraved on them, and
carefully carved pieces of stone. These
carvings are most curious and excellently
finished. They represent human heads and
many animals, such as the bear, otter, wolf,
beaver, raccoon, frog, rattlesnake, heron, crow,
&amp;c. A people, then, who could do these
things and took pleasure in doing them must
have possessed great intelligence and a
knowledge of things far beyond a simple
state. They even had religious ideas, such
as they were, for they had places for sacrifice.
All their works are now overgrown by forests,
but it is impossible to mistake them; yet the
native Indians of Ohio living now have no
idea that such a people lived in their country
before them, and no tradition at all about a
people whose civilization was so far superior
to their own.</p>

<p>We may come nearer to our own times,
and look at the Assyrians and Egyptians.
Until quite recently nothing was known about
the Assyrians except what could be learned
from the few references made to them in
Scripture and some ancient writers; but Mr.
Layard dug up their cities, and found that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
they possessed the arts of building, sculpture,
working in metals, and a written language.
All this was buried under the sand of a
desert! Then there is the great Pyramid
of Egypt, built in a way that we could not
surpass, and with much knowledge of geometry
and other sciences.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The men who
designed and constructed these works could
not have lived among a half-barbarous people;
and as these are the highest works of the
people, how much there must have been
that went before, of which there is no trace
now, when Assyria and Egypt were in <em>their</em>
age of stone axes and flint arrow-heads.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Stone-Age men
of Europe were nearly so civilized. At all
events, they have not left any such imperishable
monuments as the gigantic images of
Easter Island, the earthworks of the Ohio
people, or the sculptures, writings, and buildings
of the Assyrians and Egyptians; but they
might have been more civilized than they
seem to have been from their simple weapons
and tools. They might have made many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
things which were perishable, and have been
destroyed by time—things which would have
given us a higher belief in their intelligence
and civilization.</p>

<p>The past history of the human race may
be compared to the rise and fall of the tide.
Wave after wave has risen higher and higher
on the everlasting shore of Time, and when
the tide was at its highest it has fallen again
slowly, to rise again and again in the same
way through many ages. We know that
man may rise slowly from a simple condition
to much civilization and power, and may
again sink back almost to barbarism, as has
been the case with the people of whom we
have been speaking, and then again a new
civilization may grow up. It is possible that
all now savage nations are the sinking descendants
of some, in comparison, once civilized
people. Modern nations are taking up
the ground of savages all over the world, and
soon there will be no trace of these simple
people. Thus it may have been with mankind
throughout all the time during which
they have occupied the earth, and so it may
be perhaps again.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> now put “The Puzzle of Life” together
as well as I can, and there is not much
more to say. You must do the rest for yourselves
by going to the Museums, where all
the pieces are collected, and seeing them with
your own eyes. When you stand before
these silent witnesses to the great age of our
Earth, and all that is on it, you will feel how
wonderful the story they tell is. They have
no words to speak to you, but there is a power
in your own minds which interprets their history
through your own thoughts. They are
only lumps of rock and lifeless bones, but
they seem to say to you, “We are living again
now, because we are teaching you a lesson
which the great Builder of this Universe
wishes you to learn from us. There is not a
stone or fossil among us but it has its tale
to tell—a tale of time and tide, and long past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
ages, and innumerable changes, and a life that
was, and progress from a lower to a higher
existence. We have obeyed the same eternal
laws of one Creator from the beginning,
as all things will to the end of time. We
have opened the great Book of Nature from
the first page of the ‘life-dawn animal’ to the
last, on which the hand of the Almighty has
written the name of Man—his most perfect
work. We, you, and all things which have
lived and will live, have bodies made of
particles which will be returned to the Earth,
no single atom of which has been destroyed
since the first, but has been fashioned over
and over again into innumerable forms of
tree and flower, of gossamer-winged insect
and towering mammoth, throughout the long
ages in which our Globe has known day and
night, cold and heat, summer and winter.”</p>

<p>There is nothing sad, if we look at it
rightly, in this constant succession of life and
death. It is</p>

<p>Is it not worth while then to listen to these
stories of the Earth—to spell them out for
ourselves? They are written everywhere,—in
the mountains and valleys, the rivers and
seas, on the hard faces of granite cliffs, on the
rounded pebbles of the sea beach, and even
in the finest dust of the roads. We have not
to go far to hear them: every foot-step on
the ground covers a chapter great or small in
the universal history, and the stone walls of
our houses could speak with ten thousand
tongues of all they witnessed in their long
life on the floor of an ancient ocean.</p>

<p>We can scarcely have a more pleasant
occupation and greater interest than in searching
for and putting together the pieces of this
wonderful and beautiful puzzle, and in doing
our utmost to “Summon from the shadowy
Past the forms that once have been.”</p>

<p>‘The present little work, which is specially addressed to children,
is written in so pleasant and easy a style, and its descriptions of
life on the earth are on the whole so simple and accurate, that we
can heartily recommend it to the attention of those who seek such
a guide. The illustrations are good, and the general appearance of
the book such that it may compare most favourably with other
primers of geology.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Geological Magazine.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘Written in clear and simple style, especially attractive to
children. It includes an account of pre-historic man, and shows in
many other ways that the writer is familiar with some of the
latest phases of geological thought.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Academy.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The avowed object of this charming little book is to place the
results of these researches within the grasp of children, by presenting
them in language at once clear, simple, and winning.... In this
hard task Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicols</span> has succeeded admirably, without resorting
to that base subterfuge—the attempt to clothe instruction in the
guise of fiction.... This is true education, for it teaches children
first to observe and then to reason.... Though the style of this
delightful book is simple and childlike, it is as far as possible
removed from being childish.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Pall Mall Gazette.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The language is plain, the descriptions are lucid, the illustrations
apt, and the broad facts of the science are very correctly stated.
The work, too, is free from all attempts at fine writing.... We
wish the book success as at any rate an attempt to lay before the
young fact instead of fiction.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Quarterly Journal</span> of <span class="smcap">Science</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The book is a successful attempt to explain the simplest facts
of geology, and of the succession of life on the earth.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Westminster Review.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The idea is a happy one, and will recommend itself to children;
and we are bound to say that Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicols</span> has carried out his idea
remarkably well, and produced a work which will do much to spread
sound notions upon the gradual development of our earth and its
inhabitants to the condition in which we now see them.... We
can safely recommend Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicols’</span> little book as one that will
have a most beneficial effect in opening the minds of its young
readers.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Popular Science Review.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘This is a good little book, cleverly written by an able geologist,
and well adapted for children. We can recommend the volume as
a present to any intelligent boy or girl.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lancet.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘This book appears to be, in style, language, and scope, eminently
adapted for its purpose, which is to awaken among the little folks
an interest “in the history of life upon the earth,” and “give them
the taste for more extended study in after years.”’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Illustrated London News.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘“Though these pages are designed for young persons,” says the
Author, “other readers, perhaps, who are not familiar with the
subject, may find some interest in them, if they are not deterred by
the necessarily simple style,”—which, we venture to say, they most
assuredly will not be.... To many grown persons, therefore, as well
as their descendants, will this book be a great boon, which, if they
are at all liberal-minded, they will advocate as well as appreciate....
Like the Science Primers of Professors Huxley, Roscoe, Balfour
Stewart, &amp;c., if duly read and weighed, it will tend to unravel and
sweep away a deal of baneful superstition.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Land</span> and <span class="smcap">Water</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘That Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicols</span> has succeeded in the object he proposed to
himself may be safely affirmed. He has done his work briefly and
lucidly, and has produced a book capable of arresting the attention,
not only of children, but of those from whom they receive their
earlier lessons.’</p>

<p class="right">
The <span class="smcap">Country</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘A perfect “Open Sesame” for young scientific students, and so
cleverly composed as to make students of those who are not scientific:
not merely the young, but older people too. Mr. <span class="smcap">Nicols</span> thoroughly
understands his work.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Notes</span> and <span class="smcap">Queries</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘Easily and attractively written for young people.... The treatment
of so wide a subject, and the condensing it into a volume of
150 pages is no light task. We can, however, congratulate Mr.
<span class="smcap">Nicols</span> upon having accomplished it in so judicious, perhaps, better
still, so suggestive a manner; and we have no doubt that his little
book will become a well-worn favourite in the hands of all
thoughtful and intelligent children who may be so fortunate as to
possess it.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Engineer.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The manner in which the pieces of the puzzle—fossils—are
found, put together, and interpreted, is related in language readily
understood by children; the description of the vegetable, animal,
and human parts being peculiarly interesting. The illustrations
are the best of the kind with which we are acquainted.... We
strongly recommend it.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Schoolmaster.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘It is the puzzle as to the history of life on the earth unravelled
in a manner to interest and enlighten the minds, and to develop
the observing and reflecting faculties of children.... The results of
costly and laborious investigations in many different branches of
science are concentrated in these free and easy lessons or colloquial
lectures to young children.... Calculated to arouse an interest in
all but the dullest and most indifferent juvenile minds.... Will be
found invaluable to teachers and a great help in the rational cultivation
of the intelligence of the rising generation.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">School Board Chronicle.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘The statement of these facts, though made with all the sobriety
due to a scientific discourse, has all the interest of a story for the
young; and the narrative, if we mistake not, will interest other
readers than those for whom it is primarily written. A word of
commendation must be given to the illustrations, which are exceedingly
well drawn.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Educational Times.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘To place the “simple truths of science” in rivalry with fairy
tales and merry picture-books is not so hopeless as at first sight
may seem; and certainly the simple, attractive style in which the
marvels of the physical world are here set out must not only interest,
but charm every bright child of eager intellect. Simplicity is
observed to the utmost, but it is the simplicity of truth, so that the
child is not interested at the expense of having afterwards to unlearn
what he has read or listened to.’</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Liverpool Weekly Albion.</span><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Nicols</span> has attempted a task which at first sight
seems extremely difficult, but which he has successfully achieved....
Children can scarcely help understanding and being interested
in the wonderful story of the earth’s crust, and of past organic life
upon it, which he unfolds. There is nothing childish about his
style, yet he writes with perfect simplicity.... A better book to
put into the hands of thoughtful children, or for use as a text-book
by persons engaged in the private tuition of the young, it would
be difficult to find.’</p>

<p class="right">
The <span class="smcap">Scotsman</span>.<br>
</p>
<br>

<p>‘Facts are stranger than any fancies which emanate from the
writers of even fairy tales, and when they can be brought home to
youthful students by ocular demonstrations the facts are invariably
preferred to the fancies.... The illustrations which adorn the book
are well drawn, and sufficiently numerous for the purpose.... The
Author is a genial and reliable guide to a solution of the puzzle of
life.’</p>
